195,"My sister keeps telling me, she says, Sometimes you're just like Granny, you treat people wrong for the wrong reasons.","Mushiki wanjye akomeza kumbwira ko rimwe na rimwe uba umeze nka nyogokuru, ugirira abantu nabi bitewe n'impamvu zitari zo."
196,"Um, then we moved to a new house.",Hanyuma twimukiye mu nzu nshya.
198,"I was like, OK, well that's good, you know, like that.","Njyewe-""Okay, ibyo ni byiza, sha sha, ni uko""."
199,"And the spots of paint would change every hundred degrees, it might be red, it change to blue.","Kandi ibicengezi by'urushundura byahindukaga buri digirezi ijana, bishobora kuba byarabaga byitukura, cyangwa byarahindutse ubururu."
200,"I ate real quick, as fast as I could and then she came in there and she ended up helping me with it.","Narye vuba cyane, vuba uko nshoboye, hanyuma araza arangira amfasha."
202,Her sister's husband was light-skinned too.,Umugabo wa mushiki we na we yari afite uruhu rwiza.
204,"Anyway, they come up with this invention of the high O2 regulator.","Uko byagenda kose, baje guhanga uwo mugenzuzi w'umwuka w'umwuka w'umwuka w'umwuka w'umwuka w'umwuka w'umwuka w'umwuka."
205,"And so, we moved to Las Vegas, NV, and I reported, just like I did in Washington, to a certain address in downtown Las Vegas.","Twahungiye mu mujyi wa Las Vegas, muri leta ya Nevada, maze nk'uko nabikoze i Washington, njya ku aderesi imwe yo mu mujyi wa Las Vegas."
206,"Ah, fourth grade was a lot of fun.","Ah, mu mwaka wa kane byari bishimishije cyane."
207,"It's like one file with a whole bunch of tabs, of different, you know, each tab has like a different spreadsheet on it.","Ni nk'ifoto imwe ifite amapaji menshi atandukanye, buri tab ifite ikarita itandukanye."
209,I don't care how you get it done.,Sinshishikazwa n'uko ubikora.
211,And they moved to Mallard Creek in Charlotte.,"Hanyuma bimukiye mu mugi wa Mallard Creek, mu mugi wa Charlotte."
213,"Where he was a , he was a minister's son, so he had, they had property, and stuff, and they were very well-connected in the community and very, held in high esteem.","Aho yari ari, yari umwana w'umushumba, bityo yari afite, bari bafite umutungo, n'ibindi, kandi bari bafite imibanire myiza cyane mu baturage kandi bakunzwe cyane."
215,"And I um, I didn't know how much detail he wanted.",Kandi sinari nzi ko yifuzaga kumenya byinshi.
218,"And um, it's different, like under each client, is all their files.","Kandi... bitandukanye, nk'aho buri mukiriya yaba afite dosiye zose."
219,"It's like more simplified, like the one that she had given me was all detailed and complicated and the second one is all simple.","Ni nk'aho byoroshye, nk'uko yabihaye yari yuzuye kandi ari ibintu byimbitse, naho iya kabiri ikaba yoroshye."
220,"Cause they didn't actually live in Augusta, they lived in, well you know, Augusta was still a city-town during that time, even though to people in big cities like this Augusta isn't that big.","Kubera ko mu by'ukuri batigeze baba muri Augusta, ahubwo babaga mu mugi, uhoraho muri icyo gihe, nubwo abantu bo mu migi minini nka Augusta babona ko Augusta atari nini cyane."
221,"Late 1962, uh, I got orders to go to Washington, D.C.","Mu mpera z'umwaka wa 1962, nahawe amabwiriza yo kujya i Washington, D.C."
222,"When DOT took his property, we moved to a smaller, smaller area in Concord where you are not allowed to have animals because it's zoned and so that's the end of the animal story.","Igihe DOT yafataga umutungo we, twimukiye mu gace gato cyane ka Concord aho utagomba kugira inyamaswa kuko ari ahantu hakenewe cyane, bityo iyo nkuru y'inyamaswa irangira."
223,"Anyway, we deployed and I can tell now be, because of this that, that, that, uh, we deployed to Kadina, Okinawa, and this was in 1968.","Uko byagenda kose, twashyizwe mu gisirikare, kandi ubu ndabibona, kubera ibyo, ibyo, uh, twashyizwe mu gisirikare i Kadina, Okinawa, kandi ibyo byabaye mu mwaka wa 1968."
224,He told me what exactly he needed and that he did need it by today.,"Yambwiye ibyo yari akeneye, kandi ko yari abikeneye kugeza uyu munsi."
225,She had gone already and she told me just don't worry about it.,Yari yaragiye kandi yambwiye ko nta cyo bitwaye.
226,"This is just, you know, Look you're in trouble.","Gusa, urumva ko uri mu kaga."
227,"My, my mother wound up not being one of his favorites early on and, ah, so she was relegated to working in the fields whereas some of the other kids didn't work in the fields.","Mama we ntiyari umukunda cyane, kandi yajyanywe mu mirima, abandi bana bo ntibakoreraga mu mirima."
228,"And so you know, eventually, you know, you know, they kept asking people around, and nobody knew where they were, and eventually, you know, they just reconciled themselves that they just wouldn't see Joe again.","Kandi se, amaherezo, barahise, barabaza abantu, kandi nta muntu wari uzi aho bari, amaherezo, barahuzaga ko batongeye kubona Joe."
229,I told them my sister's.,Nabwiye abo bavandimwe ko ari aba mushiki wanjye.
230,"And she said then her mama, her mama leaned forward, and she looked and she said, Walks like him.","Hanyuma nyina aravuga ati ""Njyewe ndabona ari we ugenda""."
232,"you know, and she's stuffing the petals up there and I didn't really know of any consequences.","Uzi ko ariho, kandi ariho arimo kwinjiza amababi mu nda, kandi sinari nzi ko hari ingaruka."
234,"Ah, another thing that happened there that I thought was interesting was one of the first memories of my sister, and that was in that very same backyard.","Ikindi kintu cyabayeho aho ngaho, nakibonye ko gishishikaje, ni kimwe mu bintu bya mbere twibukaga kuri mushiki wanjye, kandi cyabereye muri iyo nzu y'inyuma."
236,"So all that stressing and I mean, I had every reason to stress today, it was like, you're giving something you don't know how to do, and it's like here do it.","Ubwo rero, iyo mihangayiko yose, kandi ni ukuvuga ko nari mfite impamvu zose zo kwiheba uyu munsi, byari nk'aho ari nk'aho utanga ikintu utazi gukora, kandi ni nk'aho ari hano ukigikora."
237,"So now, here it is, he wants it today.","Ubu rero, dore ko ari uyu munsi."
238,And unfortunately we moved again.,Ikibabaje ni uko twongeye kwimuka.
242,"I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.","Mu by'ukuri sinari nzi neza ko Mme Faulk yari afite imyaka 80, kandi yari umuntu mwiza cyane."
244,"We lived off, um, 85 in Mallard Creek where currently the 485 is now cause then the like last ten years we had to move because of the 485.",Twari dutuye mu nzu ya 85 i Mallard Creek aho ubu iyo 485 iri kubera ko nyuma y'imyaka icumi ishize twagiyeyo kubera iyo 485.

248,He's old enough to be my daddy.,Afite imyaka yo kuba papa wanjye.
249,"Everything is linked, and gosh, I don't even know how long.","Ibintu byose birimo isano, kandi sinzi n'igihe bizamara."
250,This time I wasn't even happy that she was there because I was so stressed out.,"Icyo gihe, sinashimishijwe n'uko yari ahari kubera ko nari mfite stress."
251,and that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs,kandi ibyo byinshi biterwa n'uko ababyeyi babo banywa ibiyobyabwenge
252,yeah it's real nice has it been raining,"Yewe, birashimishije cyane."
253,oh what human life is worth and whether or not you can rehabilitate somebody,"Mbese ubuzima bw'umuntu bufite agaciro kangana iki, kandi se ushobora kuvura umuntu cyangwa utabifite?"

263,no they're still they're still on tour they've been touring since late sixties,"Oya, baracyari mu birori byo gutaramira kuva mu mpera z'imyaka ya za 60."
264,how would you do aerobics,wakora ute imyitozo ngororamubiri

271,gun control means using two hands,kugenzura imbunda bisobanura gukoresha amaboko yombi
272,and uh but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but,"Ariko mu buryo butunguranye, byaturutse ahantu runaka. Sinzi aho biturutse."
274,no in fact i'm not even familiar with it i don't think,Oya mu by'ukuri sinzi uko byagenze sinumva ko ari byo

278,its really bad out here we just had a freeway shooting about three blocks from our house,Ni bibi cyane hano hanze. Twari dufite umuriro wo ku muhanda hafi y'inzu yacu.
280,uh-huh that's true it is it's not really uh consistent,uh-huh ibyo ni ukuri ntabwo aribyo uh uh uh ihoraho

286,one time we did go that thing uh there we came back from an event and turned the lights on around the camp site and there's a skunk right,Umunsi umwe twagiye muri icyo kintu uh uh uh aho twavuye mu birori maze turabatura amatara hirya no hino mu nkambi kandi hari igishanga

288,and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight,kandi byatuma abantu bakomeza guhugura imyanda yabo uh uh uh uh no kugabanya ubunini birashoboka ko ari hafi y'ikibazo nyacyo kuruta kugabanya ibiro
290,so if there's a mistake it's your mistake i guess,"Niba rero hari ikosa, ni wowe warikoreye"

315,so it it looked pretty sharp,Bityo byasaga n'aho ari byiza
316,and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in another it once it gets full getting it loaded into the car and taking it is a pain,"kandi tuzigama imifuka yacu mu kintu kimwe n'icy'icyuma mu kindi n'icy'impapuro mu kindi.

847,"I killed him, it is true.","Ni jye wamwishe, ni ukuri."

864,I will take leave to doubt it.  His lordship's tone abated nothing of its asperity.,Nta kintu na kimwe cy'ubujiji bwa Lords cyigeze kigabanya.
865,"There was here quite plainly a vague threat, a mutinous spirit he could not understand.","Aha hantu hari hari hari akaga katagaragara, umwuka wo kwigomeka atashoboraga gusobanukirwa."
866,Don't be forgetting that.   Jeremy clenched his hands.,Ntuzibagirwe ko Jeremy yafashe ukuboko.
869,But it gave no pause to the gunner's intention.,Ariko nta cyo byagezeho ku ntego y'uwo mushoferi.
870,But Blood's mind was now made up.,Ariko noneho Blood yari yafashe umwanzuro.
871,"Why, as I was just telling his lordship here, who thought like you that having Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe, not for his mother would that filthy slaver forgo what's due to him.","Nk'uko nabibwiye Nyagasani, nawe wibwiraga ko kuba Miss Bishop ari kumwe natwe byatuma turushaho kugira umutekano, ariko si ko nyina we yatumye uwo mucakara w'umunyambaraga yirengagiza ibyo amugomba."
872,"In his cabin on the starboard side Lord Julian, disturbed by the same sounds, was already astir and hurriedly dressing.","Mu nzu ye yari ku ruhande rw'iburyo, Lord Julian, wari uhangayitse bitewe n'izo mpumuro, yari amaze guhangayika kandi yihuta cyane."
875,Let me present Captain Blood.   Perforce Bishop must put on the best face he could command.,Reka mbabwire Captain Blood ko Bishop agomba gukora uko ashoboye kose.
881,"Pitt, at his post beside the helmsman, turned intrepidly to face the excited gunner.","Pitt, wari ku ntebe ye iruhande rw'umusare, yarahindukiye atinya guhangana n'umunyacumu w'umunyacumu."
882,Blood leaned over the rail to speak to the fair young man immediately below him by the helmsman at the whipstaff.,"Amaraso y'umuntu yari yarahagaze hejuru y'iyo karubanda kugira ngo avugane n'umusore mwiza wari munsi ye, ari kumwe n'umusirikare wari ku ntebe y'ibiro by'ishami."
883,"The country is all, sir; the sovereign naught.","Igihugu ni cyo cyose, mwami; nta kintu na kimwe cy'ikirenga."
884,His hand closed over the butt of one of the pistols slung before him.,Yafashe ukuboko kwe ku munwa w'imwe mu mfuti yari imbere ye.
886,It gives him a grievance at last.,"Amaherezo, ibyo byamuteye agahinda."
887,"Wait!  Blood bade him, interrupting, and he set a restraining hand upon the gunner's arm.","Amaraso yaramubwiye, aramutandukanya, maze ashyiraho ukuboko kw'umunyago."
889,"And for all that he lost nothing of his outward stern composure, fear invaded his heart.","Nubwo nta kintu na kimwe cyamushishikaje, umutima we warashenguwe n'ubwoba."
893,Through her and through you.,Binyuze kuri we no kuri wowe.
894,Though we had a cargo of Bishop's nieces it wouldn't make him hold his hand.,"Nubwo twari dufite umutwaro w'abahungu b'abahungu ba Bishop, ntibyamwemereraga gufata ukuboko."
895,If now he can show that....,Niba noneho ashobora kugaragaza ko...
896,That is what we were advised.,Ibyo ni byo twabwiwe.
897,How?  she asked him with a sudden startled interest.,Yamubajije ibibazo byamukoze ku mutima.
898,"‘Twill be a kindness, so it will.   For a moment she stood before him with quickened breathing, the colour ebbing and flowing in her cheeks.","Ni ubuntu, kandi ni ko buzaba."
899,He was moved to raise his voice above its usual languid level.,Yumvaga agomba kongera ijwi rye hejuru y'aho ryari ryogeye.
900,My name is Wade--Lord Julian Wade.,"Nitwa Wade, ni Umwami Julian Wade."
901,"I see, sir, that you do not yet quite apprehend the circumstances.","Ndabona, bwana, ko mutarabasha kwiyumvisha neza uko ibintu bimeze."
902,"I am pressed,  she informed him.",Yaramubwiye ko hari icyo nshaka.
903,"As for me,  said Lord Julian, with intent to make Miss Bishop's departure free from all interference on the part of the buccaneers,  I shall remain aboard the Arabella until we reach Port Royal.","Lord Julian yaravuze ati ""kugira ngo Miss Bishop atazahagarikwa n'abajura, nzaguma ku bwato kugeza igihe tuzaba tugeze i Port Royal."
905,"Then:   You ordered it?  he said in accents of unbelief, whilst Lord Julian raised his eyebrows.","Hanyuma, Yesu yaramubajije ati ""ni wowe wayitegetse?"" maze avuga mu buryo butuma abantu batemera, mu gihe Lord Julian yari yaraburiye abantu."
906,Expressly.   His lordship waited a moment for a reply.,"Mu buryo bweruye, Umwami wacu yategereje igisubizo."
909,"You know, Peter, that it is Lord Julian alone has stood between Bishop and his hate of you.",Uzi ko Lord Julian wenyine ari we wari hagati ya Bishop n'urwango yakwangaga.
910,"But many could not resolve one way or the other until they were satisfied upon several questions, and chiefly upon one which was voiced by Ogle.","Ariko benshi ntibashoboye gukemura ikibazo kimwe cyangwa ikindi kugeza igihe bahawe ibisubizo ku bibazo byinshi, cyane cyane ku kibazo kimwe cyavuzwe na Ogle."
911,"Ye're going to deliver yourself into Bishop's hands,  Pitt warned him.",Pitt yamubwiye ko uzashyikirizwa Bishop.
912,"Standing beside Captain Blood, he looked astern, following the indication of the Captain's hand, and cried out in his amazement.","Yagiye kureba inyuma, ahagaze iruhande rwa Capitaine Blood, akurikije ikiganza cya Capitaine, maze ararira ashimishijwe."
913,"He may be right, and he may be wrong.","Ashobora kuba ari we ufite ukuri, cyangwa se akaba ari we ufite amakosa."
915,"But if she resented his tone and his words, she stifled her resentment.","Ariko iyo yabaga ashidikanya ku magambo ye, yabaga amuhemukiye."
916,I am informed that yesterday evening a frigate left the harbour having on board your associate Wolverstone and a hundred men of the hundred and fifty that were serving under you.,Mbonye ko ku mugoroba w'ejo hari ubwato bwavuye mu cyambu bufite mugenzi wawe Wolverstone n'abantu ijana mu 150 bari bakuri munsi.
919,And instantly would have recalled the words had she been able.,"Kandi iyo aza kuba yarabishoboye, yari kwibuka ayo magambo ako kanya."
920,But that it was no more than a mask for his fury and his venom was plain to all.,"Ariko ko icyo cyari ikimenyetso cy'uburakari bwe, kandi ko uburozi bwe bwari bugaragarira bose."
921,Levasseur?  He smiled a little.,Levasseur yarasetse cyane.
923,"HOSTILITIES   In the great harbour of Port Royal, spacious enough to have given moorings to all the ships of all the navies of the world, the Arabella rode at anchor.","Mu cyambu kinini cya Port Royal, cyari kinini bihagije ku buryo cyashoboraga gushyikira amato yose yo mu ngabo z'intambara zo ku isi, icyo kiyaga cya Arabella cyasimbutse."
924,He swung to Lord Julian.,Yagiye kureba Lord Julian.
925,"Good-morning to you,  he said, and added  I've blundered badly, so I have.","Yaramubwiye ati ""mugire umunsi mwiza"", yongeraho ko nakoze ikosa rikomeye, kandi rwose narakoze."
926,"He stepped back, a baffled, impotent man.","Yagiye inyuma, ari umuntu utumva neza kandi udashobora gukora icyo ashaka."
928,"Although even some o' they should know better, for there's still a few was on Barbados with us, and are acquainted like me and you with Colonel Bishop.","Nubwo hari n'abafite ubumenyi, hari n'abafite ubumenyi ku birebana na Col. Bishop."
929,"Pitt, loosely clad in shirt and breeches, leaned against the rail the while and watched him, unmistakable concern imprinted on his fair, frank countenance.","Pitt, wari wambaye umwenda n'imyenda, yarahagaze ku muhanda maze amwitegereza, afite impungenge zitumvikanaga zanditswe mu maso ye meza kandi yeruye."
930,"That'll be the signal to lie to,  said Blood, in the same listless voice; and he fetched a sigh.","Uwo ni ikimenyetso cyo kubeshya, Blood yavuze, mu ijwi rimwe nta bwikunde; kandi yahumutse."
931,"And what better are these?--Are ye afeard of a lubberly Barbados planter? Whatever ails you, Peter? I've never known ye scared afore.   A gun boomed out behind them.","Kandi iki cyiza ibi? - Ese utinya umusaruro w'ibishyimbo bya Barbados? icyo ari cyo cyose kiguhangayikishije, Peter? Sinigeze menya ko watinya mbere. imbunda yabarashe inyuma."
932,"And a couple of miles this side of it, bearing after them, came speeding three great white ships.","Kandi ku birometero bike, ubwato butatu bw'umweru bwari bugiye kubakurikira."
933,"It's our only chance, I've said, and we must take it.   The better way that was in Captain Blood's mind was the way that already he had proposed to Wolverstone.","Ni cyo cyonyine twabonye, kandi tugomba kugikoresha kuko uburyo bwiza Capitaine Blood yatekerezaga bwari ubwo yari yarasabye Wolverstone."
935,The young master's grey eyes skimmed it.,Amaso y'umwigisha wari ukiri muto yari yarahindutse.
936,Whether the men in the panic Ogle had aroused among them would take a different view from Wolverstone's he did not know.,"Ntiyari azi niba abantu bari muri iyo mpanuka Ogle yari yaratumye bagira, bari kubona ibintu mu buryo butandukanye n'ubwa Wolverstone."
937,"Heave her to, and signal to them to send a boat.   A silence of astonishment fell upon the ship--of astonishment and suspicion at this sudden yielding.","Mujye muhamagarana, mubategeke kohereza ubwato, maze ubwato bubure amahwemo, mujye muhumeka kandi mutekereze ko mugiye kugwa mu kaga."
940,I accept it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into which my own act may have brought us.,Ndabyemera nk'uburyo bumwe rukumbi bwo kuturokora twese ku karimbuka gashobora kuba katugejejeho n'ibikorwa byanjye.
942,"I... I can't think why you should speak to me like this,  she said, with less than her earlier assurance.","Sinzi impamvu wagombye kumvugisha utyo, yavuze ko nta cyo yari amubwiye mbere."
943,And the quixotic fool is running into danger at the present moment on our behalf.,"Kandi uwo mugani w'umusazi w'umunyamwete uri mu kaga muri iki gihe, ku bwacu."
944,"A thin, sour smile broke on the officer's haughty lips.",Uwo muyobozi yari afite urwenya rurangwa n'ubwikunde.
946,So that ye can be charitable in some ways!  He laughed softly.,Kugira ngo mujye mutanga imfashanyo mu buryo runaka.
947,Hark to the gentleman!  he mocked.,Uwo mugabo yarasetse.
949,"Threats will not serve, Captain.","Nta kintu na kimwe cyatuma umuntu ahura n'akaga, Kapiteni."
950,"Captain Blood's glance raked the ranks of those resolute, fierce-eyed fellows, then it came to rest again on Ogle.","Uko Captain Blood yabonye abo bagabo b'inkoramutima, baragaragaje ko bashikamye, noneho yongera kwibanda kuri Ogle."
952,"If ye're counting on pulling Bishop's heartstrings, ye're a bigger fool, Ogle, than I've always thought you was with anything but guns.","Niba wifuza ko Bishop agufata, uri umusazi ukomeye kurusha uko nabitekerezaga, utitwaje intwaro."
953,"He had found the only way, and repellent though it might be to him, he must take it.","Yari yabonye uburyo bumwe rukumbi, kandi nubwo bwari kumubuza amahwemo, yagombaga kubukoresha."
955,He threw them at me again and again.,Yanshubije incuro nyinshi.
956,That is: that he has been notified of the coming of Lord Julian Wade.,Ni ukuvuga ko yamenyeshejwe ko Lord Julian Wade aje.
957,"Oh, please.  There was real alarm in her voice.",Mu ijwi rye hari ijwi ry'amarira.
958,"Fearing to betray the latter, she took refuge in the former.","Kubera ko yatinyaga kugambanira uwo mugore, yahunze uwo mugore."
959,"You take that tone! You dare to take that tone!  she cried, astounding him by her sudden vehemence.",Wumva ute ko ari wowe ubyifuza?
960,You may have heard of me.   Captain Calverley stared hard.,"Ushobora kuba waranyumvise, Kapiteni Calverley yaranyitegerezaga cyane."
962,It isn't that.   But they were fated to misunderstand each other.,Ariko bari baragenewe gusobanukirwa nabi.
964,"If anything should happen to you, Peter,  he said, as Blood was going over the side,  Colonel Bishop had better look to himself.","Yavuze ko mu gihe amaraso yari agiye kurengaho, Colonel Bishop yagombye kwifata."
967,"I'll be getting my hat and cane and sword, and go ashore in the cock-boat.","Nzagura inkota n'inkoni yanjye, maze njye ku butaka ndi mu bwato bw'ibishashi."
968,"I must return to Colonel Bishop for my orders,  he informed them.",Yarabamenyesheje ko ngomba gusubira kwa Koloneli Bishop kugira ngo amfashe.
969,In a flash Captain Blood saw what was in their minds.,"Mu kanya gato, Capitaine Blood yabonye ibyo bari batekerezaga."
970,"I do my best,  said she.",Yavuze ko nkora uko nshoboye kose.
971,"Oh, but--by your leave--surely there is nothing to be apprehended from Colonel Bishop.",Ariko - mu gihe cy'uruhushya rwawe - nta kintu na kimwe cyafatwa kuri Colonel Bishop.
972,"I wonder, now,  he said presently,  if the mischief is of your working.","Yagize ati ""ubu noneho, mba nibaza niba ibyo bintu bibi ari ibyo ukora."
973,"Shrewd advocacy,  he approved it.",Yemeye ko ibyo bikorwa by'ubuhanga ari byo byemewe.
975,"I have something to show you.   Wondering, Lord Julian mounted the companion as he was bidden.","Hari ikintu ngomba kukwereka, nibaza niba Lord Julian yari yuriye uwo mugenzuzi nk'uko yari yabitegetswe."
976,"Before we've run another half-mile we shall be within range.   Wolverstone swore elaborately, then suddenly checked.","Mbere y'uko tugenda indi kilometero, tuzaba turi mu kirere."
977,He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.,"Ni umuntu w'umunyabugeni, ndetse ni umusazi."
978,He levelled his telescope upon that figure.,Yashyize igitero cye kuri uwo mubare.
979,"Miss Bishop was aboard the Royal Mary also, and I rescued her together with his lordship.","Miss Bishop na we yari ku bwato bwitwa Royal Mary, maze ndamutabara hamwe n'Umwami we."
980,What if he can?  Blood interrupted carelessly.,"Iyo aza kuba afite amaraso, yabaga atamufashe neza."
981,"I'll rot in hell or ever I serves the King,  he bawled in a great rage.","Nzayihora mu muriro utazima cyangwa se igihe cyose nzakorera umwami, azatakaza uburakari bwinshi."
982,"Ye're surely daft even to think of it, Peter!","Nta gushidikanya ko uri umupfapfa cyane ku buryo utekereza ko ari byo, Peter!"
983,"Standing now at the rail, with Lord Julian beside him, Captain Blood explained himself.","Igihe yari ahagaze ku muhanda, ari kumwe na Lord Julian, Kapiteni Blood yasobanuye icyo yashakaga kuvuga."
984,"A boat that had approached unnoticed from the shore came scraping and bumping against the great red hull of the Arabella, and a raucous voice sent up a hailing shout.","Ubwato bwari bwaregereye bwavuye ku nkombe butamenyekanye, bwaje busenya maze bugongana n'igicucu kinini cy'umutuku cy'iyo nyanja, maze ijwi rirenga rivuga riti ""niba ari wowe, ujye utera hejuru""."
986,"Ye'll remember afterwards that it was your hardness drove me.   She moved to depart, then checked, and faced him again.","Nyuma y'aho, uzibuka ko ubukana bwawe ari bwo bwatumye njyayo."
987,"Faith, you explain yourself after a fashion,  said he.","Faith, yavuze ko usobanura uko ubayeho."
988,"A drinker of blood, he is.",Ni umuntu unywa amaraso.
989,"It's the truth, you fool.","Ni ukuri, wa mupfu we."
990,"Heave to, Captain, and signal them to send a boat, and assure themselves that Miss is here.","Mujye muhaguruka, Kapitan, mubereke ko mufite ubwato, kandi mwiremeze ko Miss ari hano."
993,"And if ye' weren't a fool, Ogle, you wouldn't need me to tell you this.","Kandi iyo utaba uri umusazi, Ogle, ntiwari nkeneye kukubwira ibyo."
995,"And what should be happening to me, Jeremy? Sure, now, I'll be back for dinner, so I will.   Blood climbed down into the waiting boat.","Kandi se, ni iki kigomba kumbaho, Jeremy?"
996,"Just within the doorway of the alley leading to the cabin, he ran into Miss Bishop.","Ahagana ku muryango w'inzira ijyana mu nzu y'imbohe, yahuye na Nyampinga Bishop."
