222,"When DOT took his property, we moved to a smaller, smaller area in Concord where you are not allowed to have animals because it's zoned and so that's the end of the animal story.","Kane DOT okawo mwandune, ne wadar wadhi e gweng' moro matin e Concord kama ok oyieni bedo gi le nikech en kama opog gi kuonde mamoko."
223,"Anyway, we deployed and I can tell now be, because of this that, that, that, uh, we deployed to Kadina, Okinawa, and this was in 1968.","Kata kamano, ne walendo e pinyno, kendo anyalo wacho ni ne walendo e pinyno nikech mano, ne walendo e piny Kadina, Okinawa, to mano ne en higa mar 1968."
224,He told me what exactly he needed and that he did need it by today.,Ne onyisa gima ne dwarore kendo ni ne dwarore ni obedie kawuono.
225,She had gone already and she told me just don't worry about it.,"Noyudo osedhi, kendo nonyisa ni kik abed gi parruok."
226,"This is just, you know, Look you're in trouble.","En mana ni, ing'eyo, in e chandruok."
227,"My, my mother wound up not being one of his favorites early on and, ah, so she was relegated to working in the fields whereas some of the other kids didn't work in the fields.","Minwa ne ok en achiel kuom joma ohero ahinya e kinde ma ne pod otin, omiyo ne ochune ni oti e puothe to nyithindo mamoko ne ok ti e puothe."
228,"And so you know, eventually, you know, you know, they kept asking people around, and nobody knew where they were, and eventually, you know, they just reconciled themselves that they just wouldn't see Joe again.","To gikone, ne gidhi nyime penjo ji kuonde duto, to onge ng'ama nong'eyo kama ne gintie, kendo gikone, ne giyie ni koro ok gibi neno Joe kendo."
229,I told them my sister's.,Ne anyisogi ni en mar nyaminwa.
230,"And she said then her mama, her mama leaned forward, and she looked and she said, Walks like him.","Eka nowacho ni min mare, min mare noyiengore, nong'iyo kendo nowacho ni, ""Owuotho kaka en""."
232,"you know, and she's stuffing the petals up there and I didn't really know of any consequences.","ing'eyo, kendo opong'o kite mag yien kanyo to ne ok ang'eyo ni nitie gik manyalo timore."
234,"Ah, another thing that happened there that I thought was interesting was one of the first memories of my sister, and that was in that very same backyard.","Ah, gimoro machielo ma ne otimore kanyo ma ne aparo ni ne ber ne en achiel kuom gik ma ne aparo mokwongo kuom nyaminwa, kendo mano ne otimore e puodho ma ne ni kanyo."
236,"So all that stressing and I mean, I had every reason to stress today, it was like, you're giving something you don't know how to do, and it's like here do it.","Omiyo, ne an gi gik mang'eny ma ne chanda, kendo ne an gi gimomiyo ne onego abed gi parruok mang'eny, ne chalo ka gima ne imiyo ng'ato gimoro ma ne ok ing'eyo timo, to koro ne itimo."
237,"So now, here it is, he wants it today.","Omiyo, koro odwaro ni obedne kawuono."
238,And unfortunately we moved again.,Gima lit en ni ne wadar kendo.
242,"I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.","Ne ok ang'eyo Mrs. Faulk maber ahinya.

248,He's old enough to be my daddy.,En ng'at maduong' moromo bedo wuonwa.
249,"Everything is linked, and gosh, I don't even know how long.","Gik moko duto otudore, kendo ok ang'eyo kata ni biro kawo kinde maromo nade."
250,This time I wasn't even happy that she was there because I was so stressed out.,Kindego ne ok amor kata matin ni ne en kanyo nikech ne an gi parruok mang'eny.
251,and that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs,To mano en nikech mine tiyo gi yedhe mamero.

256,yeah exactly i mean by the time you get through outfitting yourself and then having to go sweat doing it uh you could you could go on a Club med uh  everything inclusive vacati on,"Ee, adieri, sama ichopo kama itimoe gik moko duto kendo nyaka ichweyi gi luoro kuom timo kamano, inyalo dhi e Club Med."
260,oh but anyway anyway um my kids are now twenty one and twenty four so i don't have to,"Oh, to kata kamano, kata kamano um nyithinda koro gin 21 kod 24 omiyo ok ochuno ni nyaka"

270,that was their goal oh,Mano e gima ne gidwaro timo.
271,gun control means using two hands,Siro bunde tiende en tiyo gi lwedo ariyo
272,and uh but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but,"To apoya nono, owuok kamoro. Ok ang'eyo kama owuokie, to"
274,no in fact i'm not even familiar with it i don't think,"Ooyo, kuom adier ok ang'eyo kata matin."
275,yeah she was great you know she,"Ee, ne en ng'at maber ahinya."
277,yeah he suggested just getting uh um a uh um a mop like you would use,"Ee, ne ochiwo paro mar kawo mop kaka ma in itiyogo"
278,its really bad out here we just had a freeway shooting about three blocks from our house,Chal marach ahinya ka wan oko. Ne wan gi masira mar ndara e ndara ma ne ni machiegni gi odwa.

286,one time we did go that thing uh there we came back from an event and turned the lights on around the camp site and there's a skunk right,"Chieng' moro ne wadhi e gima ne ni kanyo. Ne wadok e chokruok moro, ne wayiecho ler e alwora mar kambi, kendo ne nitie le moro ma ne ni kanyo."
287,you know all my children excel they're they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but,Nyithinda duto nigi lony mamalo ahinya. Gin joma beyo ahinya.
288,and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight,kendo mano bende nyalo miyo ji ochok yugi e yo matut moloyo uh kod uh kendo tong'o kwan mar yugi nyalo bedo ni chiegni gi chandruok madier moloyo tong'o pek mar yugi

772,"It's through her that we're in this trap,  Ogle stormed on.","En ema omiyo wadonjo e obadhono, Ogle ne omonjowa."
773,"She left him, and thereafter with Wolverstone, leaning upon the rail, he watched the approach of that boat, manned by a dozen sailors, and commanded by a scarlet figure seated stiffly in the stern sheets.","Noweye, kendo bang'e ka Wolverstone, ka oketo yie e wi raila, ne oneno yie ka dhi nyime, ma ne nigi jokwang' apar gariyo, kendo ma ne ichiko gi ng'at makwar mobet motegno e yie."
774,Your motives were no doubt worthy... your gratitude to him for delivering you from the Spaniards.,Onge kiawa ni ne in gi chuny maber mar duokone erokamano kuom resoi kuom Jo - Spain.
775,"Why did ye let Wolverstone and the others go?  he cried, with a touch of bitterness.","Ang'o momiyo ne iweyo Wolverstone gi jowadgi odhi? """
777,It's that cursed petticoat's making a coward of you.,Mano en nikech lawno miyo ibedo ng'at ma luor.
778,Ah! And what way may that be?,To mano ne dhi timore nade?
779,"Ogle wrenched it free, with an oath.",Ogle nogolo kidono gi kuong'ruok.
780,I do not grant the King's commission lightly.,Ok ami migawo mar Ruoth mayot.
781,He realized that he might have to retreat in a hurry.,Ne ofwenyo ni ne nyalo dwarore ni odar mapiyo.
782,Even now Blood had no eyes for that.,"Kata mana gie sani, Blood ne ok nyal neno gima kamano."
783,"And yet he has been what he has been and done what he has done in these last three years,  said she, but she said it sorrowfully now, without any of her earlier scorn.","To ema podi ne en ng'at ma ne en, kendo notimo gik ma notimo kuom higini adek mosekalo, nowacho kamano, to nowacho kamano gi kuyo sani, maok okwedo kata matin gima ne otimorene chon."
785,I suppose that is after the fashion of your kind.,Aparo ni mano en kit ngima joma chalo kodi.
786,A frown rumpled her brow.,Ne ochako ng'iyo piny.
788,"She had been observing him with shining eyes, but at sight of his dejected countenance, and the deep frown that scarred his brow, her own expression changed.","Ne ong'iyo wang'e gi wang' mamor, to kane oneno kaka wang'e ne onyosore, kendo kaka wang'e ne opong' gi wichkuot, ne oloko pache."
792,"Walking leisurely, he skirted the embattled wall, and passed through the great gates into the courtyard.","Ne owuotho mos, koluwo ohinga ma ne nigi ohinga, kendo ne okalo e rangach maduong' mar laru."
794,Say that I look forward to making his acquaintance there.     CHAPTER XXII.,Nyise ni agombo ahinya romo kode kuno.
795,"You'll ruffle it to the gallows, no doubt,  he said contemptuously.","Nowacho e yor achaye ni, ""Ok en gima rach mondo ng'ato ochwanyre."
797,I believe that it was nothing but the hope of taking and hanging Captain Blood that made my uncle leave his Barbados plantations to accept the deputy-governorship of Jamaica.,Aparo ni geno mar mako kendo ng'ado ne ng'ato buch Kapitan Blood ema nomiyo nera oweyo puothe ma ne en - go e piny Barbados mondo oyud migawo mar bedo jalup gavana mar Jamaica.
798,How could I in honesty have detained them? It was in the bargain.,Ere kaka ne anyalo ritogi?
799,"Colonel Bishop has been notified of my coming.   The sudden change in Calverley's manner at Lord Julian's mention of his name showed that the notification had been received, and that he had knowledge of it.","Kolonel Bishop ne onyis ni abiro, kendo lokruok ma ne otimore apoya e yo ma Calverley ne timogo kane Lord Julian owuoyo kuome, nonyiso ni ne oseyudo wachno, kendo ni nong'eyo wachno."
801,"At the head of the companion, Ogle found his progress barred by Blood, who confronted him, a sudden sternness in his face and in every line of him.","Ka en e wi osiepne, Ogle ne oyudo ka dhi nyime mar ngimane ok dhi maber nikech remo, ma ne okedo kode, ne en gi mirima mager e wang'e kendo e weche duto ma ne owacho."
804,I've been hunting him this year past.,Ne asiko aluwe kuom higa achiel mosekalo.
805,"At that moment a lane was opened in the ranks of the men, and through this came Miss Bishop followed by her octoroon woman.","E kindeno, ne nitie ng'at moro ma ne ni e kind chwo, kendo ne en Miss Bishop ma ne oluwo bang'e gi dhako ma ne nigi kido mar aboro."
806,"They are ships of the Jamaica fleet,  his lordship answered her.","Ne gin meli mag jolweny mag Jamaica, Ruoth nodwoke."
807,And for what had he placed himself in this position? For the sake of a girl who avoided him so persistently and intentionally that he must assume that she still regarded him with aversion.,"To nikech nyako moro ma ne otame gi chunye duto, ne ok onyal yie ni ne pod ochaye."
808,"You may be right, and you may be wrong.","Nyalo bedo ni in kare, kata inyalo bedo ni in kare."
809,"You have granted, I am told, the King's commission to this man.  His very tone betrayed the bitterness of his rancour.","Ne owachna ni ne imiyo ng'atni migawo mar Ruoth, kendo dwonde owuon nonyiso ni ne en gi mirima."
810,"She was very white, and she kept her eyes upon her folded hands.","Ne en dhako ma ne rachar ahinya, kendo ne ok oweyo wang'e mondo ochom e lwetene."
811,So they've told you about that!,"Omiyo, ne ginyisi wachno!"
812,"She realized that perhaps she had, herself, provoked his anger.",Ne ofwenyo ni samoro en owuon ema ne omiyo iye owang'.
813,I shall always be grateful.,Abiro bedo mamor kodi kinde duto.
814,"Not for his niece, not for his daughter, not for his own mother, would he forgo the blood what he thinks due to him.","Kata mana ne nyamin nyamin mare, kata ne nyare, kata ne min mare owuon, ok obi weyo chwero remo ma en owuon oparo ni en mare."
815,"Abeam with the Arabella, across the harbour, were the flat-fronted white buildings of that imposing city that came down to the very water's edge.","Abeam gi Arabella, ma ne ni loka nam, ne gin ute ma rochere ma ne ni e bath nam."
816,"In my own I've done nothing at all that I am ashamed of, considering the provocation I received.   Her glance faltered, and fell away before his own that was so intent.","Ne ok atimo gimoro amora ma ne nyalo miyo wiya kuodi, nikech ne okonya ahinya."
817,"And maybe it won't.  Slow and mocking came Wolverstone's voice to answer the other's confident excitement, and as he spoke he advanced to Blood's side, an unexpected ally.","Kendo samoro ok bi bedo kamano. dwol Wolverstone ne dwoke mos kendo ka jaro, mondo odwok mor ma ne ng'at machielo nigo, kendo kane owuoyo, ne ochako dhi e bath Blood, ma ne en osiepne ma ne ok apar."
818,You were just an unfortunate gentleman then.,Ne in mana ng'at ma ne onge gi mor.
821,Captain Blood bared his head and bowed silently in a greeting which she returned composedly and formally.,"Jatend jolweny miluongo ni Blood ne oumo wiye mi olamo gi dwol mapiny, to ne odwoke gi chuny mokuwe."
822,There had been trouble with Bishop from the moment of landing.,Ne nitie chandruok gi Bishop chakre sa ma ne gichopo.
823,Meanwhile Ogle was growing impatient.,"E kindeno, Ogle ne medo bedo gi chuny monyosore."
824,"Lord Julian was sententious, as I gather that he often was.","Ruoth Julian ne en ng'at ma ne ng'ado bura e yo makare, mana kaka asewinjo ni ne en kamano kinde mang'eny."
825,"Aye--a deal of lies, devil a doubt, as I could prove to you.","Ee, miriambo mang'eny, kendo kiawa, kaka anyalo nyisi."
827,But I was in haste to land you.,"Kata kamano, ne adwaro ni mondo akelgi mapiyo."
828,You should have seen the danger.,Ne onego ine kaka ne en kama rach.
829,"I realize fully what you did, and I realize that partly, at least, you may have been urged by consideration for myself.","Ang'eyo maber gima ne itimo, kendo ang'eyo ni samoro ne ichiko iti nikech ne idewa."
831,"I'll not be detaining you any longer, ma'am.","Ok abi dhi nyime makowa, minwa."
834,It's our only chance....   The rest of his words were drowned in the shouts of the hands insisting that the girl be given up to be held as a hostage.,Mano e geno kende ma wan-go... weche mamoko ma nowacho ne opong' gi koko mag lwedo ma ne dwaro ni nyako ochiw mondo omakgo kaka joma omak.
835,That is not in the bargain.,Mano ne ok en gima ne wawinjore.
840,"He observed her pale and tense, with parted lips and startled eyes that were fixed upon him, an anxious witness of this deciding of her fate.","Ne oneno ka dende rachwer kendo ochako bedo gi parruok, kendo wang'e ne ochako neno mana kaka ne ochalo."
841,And she shivered at the memory of it.,Kendo ne oluor koparo wachno.
842,"Aye!  roared in chorus the buccaneers below, and one or two of them elaborated that affirmation.","Ee! ne giwer gi mor ka giwacho ni, ""Mano en adier!"""
846,"In the cabin he flung into a chair, and exploded, with a violence altogether foreign to his nature.","Ne oketo ng'atno e kom, mi nowang', ka en gi mirima ma ne ok ong'eyo."
847,"I killed him, it is true.",Adiera en ni ne anege.
848,"Captain,  he said, and as he spoke he pointed to the pursuing ships,  Colonel Bishop holds us.","Ne owacho ni, ""Kapteni, "" kendo kane owuoyo, ne onyiso meli ma ne luwe, Kolonel Bishop ne omakowa."
849,"That'll cool Colonel Bishop's heat, maybe.",Mano nyalo miyo Colonel Bishop obed gi mirima.
850,Your station is on the gun-deck.,Migawo mari ni e wi gige lweny.
853,"So I heard,  she admitted in a small voice.",Ne awinjo ni ne oyie gi wachno gi dwol mapiny.
856,"But laugh though he might, he knew as well as Pitt that in going ashore that morning he carried his life in his hands.","Kata kamano, kata obedo ni ne onyalo nyiero, nong'eyo maber mana kaka Pitt ni kane ochopo e dho wath gokinyi, ne en gi ngima e lwete."
857,I... I had not dreamed....,Ne ok aparo ni...
859,But there is no hope for him in that!  she cried.,To ne ok onyal timo kamano!
864,I will take leave to doubt it.  His lordship's tone abated nothing of its asperity.,"Ok abi bedo gi kiawa kuom wachno, nikech dwol ma ne owuoyogo ne ok odwok chien mirimbe."
865,"There was here quite plainly a vague threat, a mutinous spirit he could not understand.","Ne nenore maler ni ne nitie gimoro ma ne nyalo miyo ng'ato odonj e lweny, kendo ne ok onyal winjo tiend gima ne timore."
866,Don't be forgetting that.   Jeremy clenched his hands.,"Kik wiyi wil ni, Jeremy ne ochako choko lwetene."
869,But it gave no pause to the gunner's intention.,"Kata kamano, ne ok omono jalno timo kamano."
870,But Blood's mind was now made up.,"Kata kamano, koro Blood noseng'ado mar timo kamano."
871,"Why, as I was just telling his lordship here, who thought like you that having Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe, not for his mother would that filthy slaver forgo what's due to him.","Mana kaka ne awacho ne ruodhe, ng'at ma ne paro kaka in ni bedo gi Miss Bishop e yie ne dhi miyo wabed gi ngima maber, ok ne min mare, ne ok nyal weyo gima ne owinjore gi misumba ma ne ok lerno."
872,"In his cabin on the starboard side Lord Julian, disturbed by the same sounds, was already astir and hurriedly dressing.","E ode man yo korachwich, Ruoth Julian, ma bende ne winjo koko ma kamano, ne koro ywak kendo rwako lewni mapiyo."
875,Let me present Captain Blood.   Perforce Bishop must put on the best face he could command.,"Weuru anyisu Kapitan Blood, ma nyaka bed ni Bishop ne nigi kido maberie moloyo."
881,"Pitt, at his post beside the helmsman, turned intrepidly to face the excited gunner.","Pitt, ma ne ni e komne machiegni gi jatend meli, nolokore gi chir mondo orom gi jal ma ne goyo bunde."
882,Blood leaned over the rail to speak to the fair young man immediately below him by the helmsman at the whipstaff.,Remo ne riyo e wi raila mondo owuo gi rawera ma ne ni e bwoye gi jatend meli.
883,"The country is all, sir; the sovereign naught.","Piny en gimoro amora, Ruoth; ruoth en gimoro amora."
884,His hand closed over the butt of one of the pistols slung before him.,Ne oketo lwete e achiel kuom bunde ma ne ni e nyime.
886,It gives him a grievance at last.,"Gikone, wachno miyo obedo gi ich wang'."
887,"Wait!  Blood bade him, interrupting, and he set a restraining hand upon the gunner's arm.",Remb ng'atno ne ochako chungo lwet jalno.
889,"And for all that he lost nothing of his outward stern composure, fear invaded his heart.","Kata obedo ni ne ok oweyo bedo gi chuny mokuwe, pod ne oluor."
893,Through her and through you.,Kokalo kuome koda kuomi.
894,Though we had a cargo of Bishop's nieces it wouldn't make him hold his hand.,"Kata obedo ni ne wan gi nyithi Bishop, mano ne ok nyal miyo omak lwete."
895,If now he can show that....,Kapo ni koro onyalo nyiso ni...
896,That is what we were advised.,Mano e gima ne onyiswa.
897,How?  she asked him with a sudden startled interest.,Ne openjo gi siso.
898,"‘Twill be a kindness, so it will.   For a moment she stood before him with quickened breathing, the colour ebbing and flowing in her cheeks.","Ne ochung' e nyime kuom kinde ka muya mare omedore, kendo rangi ne chuer e bade."
899,He was moved to raise his voice above its usual languid level.,Ne odwoko kowacho gi dwol mamalo moloyo kaka ne en chon.
900,My name is Wade--Lord Julian Wade.,Nyinga en Wade - Ruoth Julian Wade.
901,"I see, sir, that you do not yet quite apprehend the circumstances.",Aneno ni pok ing'eyo maber chal mar weche.
902,"I am pressed,  she informed him.","Ne owachone ni, ""Awinjo ka achandora."
903,"As for me,  said Lord Julian, with intent to make Miss Bishop's departure free from all interference on the part of the buccaneers,  I shall remain aboard the Arabella until we reach Port Royal.","To an, Ruoth Julian nowacho ni, ka agombo ni Miss Bishop owuog maonge gima biro chocho jo-pirates, abiro siko e yie mar Arabella nyaka chop kama wachopo Port Royal."
905,"Then:   You ordered it?  he said in accents of unbelief, whilst Lord Julian raised his eyebrows.","Eka nowacho ni, ""In ema ne ichiko ni otim kamano?"""
906,Expressly.   His lordship waited a moment for a reply.,Ruoth ne orito dwoko kuom kinde.
909,"You know, Peter, that it is Lord Julian alone has stood between Bishop and his hate of you.","Ing'eyo, Peter, ni Ruoth Julian kende ema osesiro Bishop gi sigu ma en-go kuomi."
910,"But many could not resolve one way or the other until they were satisfied upon several questions, and chiefly upon one which was voiced by Ogle.","Kata kamano, ji mang'eny ne ok nyal ng'eyo gima ne timore nyaka ne giyud dwoko mag penjo moko, to moloyo, achiel ma Ogle ne ochiwo."
911,"Ye're going to deliver yourself into Bishop's hands,  Pitt warned him.",Pitt nosieme ni ibiro chiwori e lwet Bishop.
912,"Standing beside Captain Blood, he looked astern, following the indication of the Captain's hand, and cried out in his amazement.","Kochung' e bath Kapitan Blood, nong'iyo chien, koluwo kaka lwete ne nyise, kendo noywak gi mor."
913,"He may be right, and he may be wrong.","Onyalo bedo kare, kendo onyalo bedo ni ok en kare."
915,"But if she resented his tone and his words, she stifled her resentment.","Kata kamano, ka ne ochwanyore nikech weche ma ne owacho, ne ok oweyo mondo mirimbe oloye."
916,I am informed that yesterday evening a frigate left the harbour having on board your associate Wolverstone and a hundred men of the hundred and fifty that were serving under you.,"Ne onyisa ni nyoro godhiambo meli moro ma ne nigi jal ma ne tiyo kodi miluongo ni Wolverstone kod ji mia achiel kuom ji mia achiel gi piero abich ma ne tiyo e bwoye, nowuok e dho wath."
919,And instantly would have recalled the words had she been able.,Kendo dine oparo wechego mapiyo kapo ni ne onyalo.
920,But that it was no more than a mask for his fury and his venom was plain to all.,"Kata kamano, ji duto ne neno ni ne en mana rageng' mar mirimbe kod sum ma ne en-go."
921,Levasseur?  He smiled a little.,Ne obwonjo matin.
923,"HOSTILITIES   In the great harbour of Port Royal, spacious enough to have given moorings to all the ships of all the navies of the world, the Arabella rode at anchor.","E dho wath maduong' mar Port Royal, ma ne nigi thuolo moromo miyo meli duto mag pinje duto ma ne nigi yie, meli miluongo ni Arabella ne ochung' e dho wath."
924,He swung to Lord Julian.,Ne ochako goyo Lord Julian.
925,"Good-morning to you,  he said, and added  I've blundered badly, so I have.","Ne owacho ni, ""Odiechieng' maber"", kae to omedo ni, ""Atimo richo maduong' ahinya, omiyo, ne atimo kamano""."
926,"He stepped back, a baffled, impotent man.","Ne odok chien, ka en ng'at ma wiye tek kendo ma wiye tek."
928,"Although even some o' they should know better, for there's still a few was on Barbados with us, and are acquainted like me and you with Colonel Bishop.","Kata obedo ni moko kuomgi onego ong'e ni gin joma kare, nikech pod nitie jomoko ma ne ni kodwa e piny Barbados, kendo ma ne ong'eyo kaka an kod in wang'eyo Kolonel Bishop."
929,"Pitt, loosely clad in shirt and breeches, leaned against the rail the while and watched him, unmistakable concern imprinted on his fair, frank countenance.","Pitt, morwako law gi bunde, ne oketo wiye e wi raum, kendo ne ong'iye, ka chunye chandore ahinya."
930,"That'll be the signal to lie to,  said Blood, in the same listless voice; and he fetched a sigh.","Mano biro bedo ranyisi mar miriambo, ""Remb nowacho, gi dwol achielno maok dew, kendo noywak."
931,"And what better are these?--Are ye afeard of a lubberly Barbados planter? Whatever ails you, Peter? I've never known ye scared afore.   A gun boomed out behind them.","To magi gin mage mabeyo moloyo? - Be iluoro chwoyo yiende mag Barbados ma nigi olembe mang'eny? Kata bed ni en ang'o ma chandi, Petro? pok ang'eyo ni iluoro gimoro amora."
932,"And a couple of miles this side of it, bearing after them, came speeding three great white ships.","To kilomita moko bang'e, meli adek madongo mag farese nobiro ka gireto."
933,"It's our only chance, I've said, and we must take it.   The better way that was in Captain Blood's mind was the way that already he had proposed to Wolverstone.","Ne awacho ni mano e thuolowa kende, kendo nyaka wati kode. yo ma ne ber moloyo ma ne nie pach Kapt. Blood ne en yo ma ne osenyisogo Wolverstone."
935,The young master's grey eyes skimmed it.,Wang'e ma rachar mar ruodhno ne oyawore.
936,Whether the men in the panic Ogle had aroused among them would take a different view from Wolverstone's he did not know.,"Kata obedo ni chwo ma ne ochako bedo gi luoro nikech Ogle ne dhi bedo gi paro mopogore gi mar Wolverstone, ne ok ong'eyo."
937,"Heave her to, and signal to them to send a boat.   A silence of astonishment fell upon the ship--of astonishment and suspicion at this sudden yielding.","Ne giwacho ni, ""Wadhiuru e yie, mondo waor yie""."
940,I accept it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into which my own act may have brought us.,Ayie gi wachno kaka yo achiel kende mar resowa kuom kethruok ma timna owuon nyalo kelonwa.
942,"I... I can't think why you should speak to me like this,  she said, with less than her earlier assurance.","Ne ok anyal ng'eyo gimomiyo ne onego iwuo koda kamano, nowacho, ka ok en gadier kaka ne en chon."
943,And the quixotic fool is running into danger at the present moment on our behalf.,"Kendo ng'at mofuwo ma ne ok ong'eyo gima timore, koro ni e chandruok nikech wan."
944,"A thin, sour smile broke on the officer's haughty lips.",Ng'at ma ne ochung'ne polisno ne obwonjo gi mor.
946,So that ye can be charitable in some ways!  He laughed softly.,Ne onyiero mos.
947,Hark to the gentleman!  he mocked.,"Ne owuoyo gi ng'atno kowachone ni, ""Winjuru!"
949,"Threats will not serve, Captain.","Ok wabi tiyo gi weche ma nyalo miyo wabed gi luoro, Kapitan."
950,"Captain Blood's glance raked the ranks of those resolute, fierce-eyed fellows, then it came to rest again on Ogle.","Wang' Kaptain Blood ne ng'iyo jogo ma ne nigi chuny motegno, kendo ma wang'gi ne tek, kae to ochako ong'iyo Ogle kendo."
952,"If ye're counting on pulling Bishop's heartstrings, ye're a bigger fool, Ogle, than I've always thought you was with anything but guns.","Ka iparo ni ibiro mako chuny Bishop, to in ng'at mofuwo moloyo kaka naparo, Ogle, to ok gi bunde."
953,"He had found the only way, and repellent though it might be to him, he must take it.","Ne oyudo yo achiel kende, kendo kata obedo ni ne ok omor gi yo ma ne oyudogo, ne nyaka oluw yorno."
955,He threw them at me again and again.,Ne obayoga bunde nyadinwoya.
956,That is: that he has been notified of the coming of Lord Julian Wade.,"Mano tiende ni, osewachne ni Ruoth Julian Wade biro."
957,"Oh, please.  There was real alarm in her voice.","Oh, akwayi, ne nitie wach moro ma ne chando chunye ahinya."
958,"Fearing to betray the latter, she took refuge in the former.","Nikech noluor ni ne onyalo ndhoge, ne oringo modhi ir wuon mare."
959,"You take that tone! You dare to take that tone!  she cried, astounding him by her sudden vehemence.","Ne owachone kama: ""Iwuoyo gi dwol machalo kamano!"
960,You may have heard of me.   Captain Calverley stared hard.,Nyalo bedo ni isewinjo kuoma.
962,It isn't that.   But they were fated to misunderstand each other.,"Ok en kamano, to ne gineno ni ne ok ginyal ng'eyo gima ne timore."
964,"If anything should happen to you, Peter,  he said, as Blood was going over the side,  Colonel Bishop had better look to himself.","Ne owacho ni kapo ni gimoro otimore ne in, Peter, kaka remo ne dhi kalo e dho wath, ne ber mondo Kolonel Bishop orit ngimane."
967,"I'll be getting my hat and cane and sword, and go ashore in the cock-boat.","Abiro kawo ogudu, luth, kod ligangla, mi adhi e dho wath gi yie mar gweno."
968,"I must return to Colonel Bishop for my orders,  he informed them.","Nyaka adog ir Kolonel Bishop mondo omiya chik, ne onyisogi kamano."
969,In a flash Captain Blood saw what was in their minds.,"E sano, Kapitan Blood noneno gima ne nie pachgi."
970,"I do my best,  said she.",Nowacho ni atimo duto manyalo.
971,"Oh, but--by your leave--surely there is nothing to be apprehended from Colonel Bishop.","Oh, to - ka iyie - onge gima inyalo mako kuom Jaland bura Bishop."
972,"I wonder, now,  he said presently,  if the mischief is of your working.","Nowacho ni, ""Awuoro ka gima timni marachno en nikech itimo kamano."
973,"Shrewd advocacy,  he approved it.","Ne otimo kinda ahinya, mi oyie gi wachno."
975,"I have something to show you.   Wondering, Lord Julian mounted the companion as he was bidden.","Nikech ne giwuoro, Ruoth Julian noidho fareseno mana kaka ne ochike."
976,"Before we've run another half-mile we shall be within range.   Wolverstone swore elaborately, then suddenly checked.","Wolverstone nokuong'ore gi weche mang'eny, kae to apoya nono."
977,He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.,En ng'at mohero lweny ahinya.
978,He levelled his telescope upon that figure.,Ne oketo telescope mare e wi ng'atno.
979,"Miss Bishop was aboard the Royal Mary also, and I rescued her together with his lordship.","Miss Bishop bende ne ni e meli miluongo ni Royal Mary, kendo ne arese kaachiel gi Ruoth."
980,What if he can?  Blood interrupted carelessly.,To nade kapo ni onyalo?
981,"I'll rot in hell or ever I serves the King,  he bawled in a great rage.","Ne oywak gi mirima maduong' kowacho ni, ""Kata ka ok atiyo ne Ruoth, to abiro chwoyo e mach."
982,"Ye're surely daft even to think of it, Peter!","Onge kiawa ni in ng'at mofuwo kata mana paro wachno, Peter!"
983,"Standing now at the rail, with Lord Julian beside him, Captain Blood explained himself.","Kochung' e bath ratil, ka Ruoth Julian ni bute, Jatelono Blood nolero tiend gima ne otimoreno."
984,"A boat that had approached unnoticed from the shore came scraping and bumping against the great red hull of the Arabella, and a raucous voice sent up a hailing shout.","Ne nitie yie moro ma ne chiegni gi dho wath ka ok ofwenyore, kendo ne gichako goyo yie maduong' mar Arabella ma ne nigi rangi makwar."
986,"Ye'll remember afterwards that it was your hardness drove me.   She moved to depart, then checked, and faced him again.","Bang'e ibiro paro ni ne en nikech mirimbi, ma ne omiyo owuok, kae to ochako onene kendo."
987,"Faith, you explain yourself after a fashion,  said he.","Faith, ne owacho ni, ""Inyalo lero wachno e yo maber""."
988,"A drinker of blood, he is.",En mana ng'at ma madho remo.
989,"It's the truth, you fool.","En adier, in ng'at mofuwo."
990,"Heave to, Captain, and signal them to send a boat, and assure themselves that Miss is here.","Nyisgi ni gior yie, kendo gine ni nyako matin ni kae."
993,"And if ye' weren't a fool, Ogle, you wouldn't need me to tell you this.","To ka dine ok in ng'at mofuwo, Ogle, dine ok idwar ni anyisi wachni."
995,"And what should be happening to me, Jeremy? Sure, now, I'll be back for dinner, so I will.   Blood climbed down into the waiting boat.","To ang'o ma onego timrena, Jeremy? remo nolwar e yie ma ne rito."
996,"Just within the doorway of the alley leading to the cabin, he ran into Miss Bishop.","Kane ochopo e dho rangach mar ndara materowa e ot, noromo gi Miss Bishop."
