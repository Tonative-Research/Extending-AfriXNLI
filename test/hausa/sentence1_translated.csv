766,I was coming out on the Royal Mary....,Ina zuwa ne a kan Royal Mary...
772,"It's through her that we're in this trap,  Ogle stormed on.","Ta wurinta ne muka shiga wannan tarkon, Ogle ya kai mu hari."
773,"She left him, and thereafter with Wolverstone, leaning upon the rail, he watched the approach of that boat, manned by a dozen sailors, and commanded by a scarlet figure seated stiffly in the stern sheets.","Ta bar shi, kuma daga baya tare da Wolverstone, jingina a kan rails, ya lura da kusanci da cewa jirgin ruwa, manned da dozin sailors, da kuma umurci da wani scarlet siffar zaune rigidly a cikin tafin sheets."
774,Your motives were no doubt worthy... your gratitude to him for delivering you from the Spaniards.,"Babu shakka, dalilinku ya cancanci... godiya ga shi domin ya cece ku daga 'yan Spain."
775,"Why did ye let Wolverstone and the others go?  he cried, with a touch of bitterness.","Me ya sa ka bar Wolverstone da sauran tafi? ya yi kuka, da wani touch na zafi."
777,It's that cursed petticoat's making a coward of you.,Wannan mahaukacin mahaukaci ne yake sa ka zama wani ɗan tsoro.
778,Ah! And what way may that be?,Kuma ta wace hanya ce wannan zai iya zama?
779,"Ogle wrenched it free, with an oath.","Ogle ya saki shi, da rantsuwa."
780,I do not grant the King's commission lightly.,Ba na karɓar umarnin sarki a hankali.
781,He realized that he might have to retreat in a hurry.,Ya fahimci cewa zai iya janyewa da gaggawa.
782,Even now Blood had no eyes for that.,Ko yanzu Blood ba ta da idanu don haka.
783,"And yet he has been what he has been and done what he has done in these last three years,  said she, but she said it sorrowfully now, without any of her earlier scorn.","Kuma duk da haka ya kasance abin da ya kasance kuma ya yi abin da ya yi a cikin wadannan shekaru uku, ta ce, amma ta ce shi saddeningly yanzu, ba tare da wani daga cikin ta baya raina."
785,I suppose that is after the fashion of your kind.,Ina tsammanin wannan ya yi daidai da salonku.
786,A frown rumpled her brow.,Wani mai fuska ya yi mata tawaye.
788,"She had been observing him with shining eyes, but at sight of his dejected countenance, and the deep frown that scarred his brow, her own expression changed.","Ta kasance yana lura da shi da m idanu, amma a gani da ya m fuskar, da kuma zurfi gashin fuska da cewa scarred ya goshi, ta kanta magana canza."
792,"Walking leisurely, he skirted the embattled wall, and passed through the great gates into the courtyard.","Da yake tafiya a hankali, ya bi bango mai cike da faɗa, kuma ya wuce ta manyan ƙofofin zuwa farfajiyar."
794,Say that I look forward to making his acquaintance there.     CHAPTER XXII.,Ka ce ina ɗokin sanin shi a wurin.
795,"You'll ruffle it to the gallows, no doubt,  he said contemptuously.","Ba shakka, za ka yi wa kanka laifi, ya ce da ƙyama."
797,I believe that it was nothing but the hope of taking and hanging Captain Blood that made my uncle leave his Barbados plantations to accept the deputy-governorship of Jamaica.,Na yi imani cewa ba wani abu ba ne sai dai fatan da za a kama da rataye Kyaftin jini wanda ya sa kawuna ya bar gonakinsa na Barbados don ya karɓi mataimakin gwamnan Jamaica.
798,How could I in honesty have detained them? It was in the bargain.,Ta yaya zan iya tsare su?
799,"Colonel Bishop has been notified of my coming.   The sudden change in Calverley's manner at Lord Julian's mention of his name showed that the notification had been received, and that he had knowledge of it.","An sanar da Kolonel Bishop na zuwa, kuma sauyin da ya faru a halin Calverley a lokacin da Lord Julian ya ambaci sunansa ya nuna cewa an samu sanarwar, kuma ya san hakan."
801,"At the head of the companion, Ogle found his progress barred by Blood, who confronted him, a sudden sternness in his face and in every line of him.","A kan shugaban abokin tarayya, Ogle ya ga ci gabansa ya hana shi jini, wanda ya fuskanta, wani gaggawa m a fuskarsa da kuma a kowane layi na shi."
804,I've been hunting him this year past.,Na yi masa farauta a wannan shekarar da ta gabata.
805,"At that moment a lane was opened in the ranks of the men, and through this came Miss Bishop followed by her octoroon woman.","A wannan lokacin an bude wani lane a cikin jerin maza, kuma ta hanyar da Miss Bishop ya zo bi ta octoroon mace."
806,"They are ships of the Jamaica fleet,  his lordship answered her.","Su jiragen ruwa ne na rundunar jiragen ruwan Jamaica, in ji ubangijinsa."
807,And for what had he placed himself in this position? For the sake of a girl who avoided him so persistently and intentionally that he must assume that she still regarded him with aversion.,Kuma me ya sa ya sa kansa a wannan matsayi? Domin wata yarinya da ta guje masa da ƙwazo da gangan cewa dole ne ya ɗauka cewa ta har yanzu kallon shi da ƙiyayya.
808,"You may be right, and you may be wrong.","Kana iya yin gaskiya, kuma kana iya yin kuskure."
809,"You have granted, I am told, the King's commission to this man.  His very tone betrayed the bitterness of his rancour.",An gaya mini cewa kun ba da umarnin sarki ga wannan mutumin.
810,"She was very white, and she kept her eyes upon her folded hands.","Tana da fari sosai, kuma ta riƙe idanunta a kan hannunta."
811,So they've told you about that!,Saboda haka sun gaya maka game da cewa!
812,"She realized that perhaps she had, herself, provoked his anger.",Ta fahimci cewa wataƙila ita ce ta sa ya yi fushi.
813,I shall always be grateful.,Zan kasance mai godiya a koyaushe.
814,"Not for his niece, not for his daughter, not for his own mother, would he forgo the blood what he thinks due to him.","Ba don 'yar'uwarsa ba, ba don' yar'uwarsa ba, ba don mahaifiyarsa ba, zai yi watsi da jinin abin da ya yi tunani saboda shi."
815,"Abeam with the Arabella, across the harbour, were the flat-fronted white buildings of that imposing city that came down to the very water's edge.","A kusa da Arabella, a gefen tashar jiragen ruwa, akwai gine-ginen fararen fata na wannan birni mai girma da suka sauka zuwa ga bakin teku."
816,"In my own I've done nothing at all that I am ashamed of, considering the provocation I received.   Her glance faltered, and fell away before his own that was so intent.","A cikin kaina na yi kome ba abin da na ji kunya, la'akari da tsokana na samu. ta kallo faltered, kuma ya fadi a gaban nasa wanda yake haka niyya."
817,"And maybe it won't.  Slow and mocking came Wolverstone's voice to answer the other's confident excitement, and as he spoke he advanced to Blood's side, an unexpected ally.","Da sannu a hankali muryar Wolverstone ta fito tana ba da amsa ga farin cikin da wani ya yi, kuma yayin da yake magana ya ci gaba zuwa wajen Blood, abokin tarayya wanda ba zato ba tsammani."
818,You were just an unfortunate gentleman then.,Kai ne kawai wani rashin alheri gentleman a lokacin.
821,Captain Blood bared his head and bowed silently in a greeting which she returned composedly and formally.,Kyaftin jini ya nuna kansa kuma ya sunkuya a cikin shiru a cikin wani gaisuwa da ta mayar da composed da kuma formally.
822,There had been trouble with Bishop from the moment of landing.,An samu matsala da Bishop tun lokacin da muka sauka.
823,Meanwhile Ogle was growing impatient.,A lokacin Ogle yana ƙara rashin haƙuri.
824,"Lord Julian was sententious, as I gather that he often was.","Lord Julian ya yi hukunci sosai, kamar yadda na fahimci cewa sau da yawa ya yi."
825,"Aye--a deal of lies, devil a doubt, as I could prove to you.","Haka ne - babban adadin ƙarya, shaidan shakka, kamar yadda na iya tabbatar da ku."
827,But I was in haste to land you.,Amma na yi sauri in sauka a gare ku.
828,You should have seen the danger.,Ya kamata ka ga haɗarin.
829,"I realize fully what you did, and I realize that partly, at least, you may have been urged by consideration for myself.","Na fahimci abin da ka yi, kuma na fahimci cewa, aƙalla, wani ɓangare, za ka iya yin hakan domin ka yi la'akari da ni."
831,"I'll not be detaining you any longer, ma'am.","Ba zan ƙara tsare ku ba, Madam."
834,It's our only chance....   The rest of his words were drowned in the shouts of the hands insisting that the girl be given up to be held as a hostage.,Wannan shine damarmu kawai... sauran kalmominsa sun nutse a cikin kukan hannayensu suna nace cewa a ba da yarinyar don a riƙe ta a matsayin mafarauci.
835,That is not in the bargain.,Wannan ba a cikin yarjejeniyar ba.
840,"He observed her pale and tense, with parted lips and startled eyes that were fixed upon him, an anxious witness of this deciding of her fate.","Ya lura da ita m da kuma tashin hankali, tare da rabu lebe da kuma mamaki idanu da aka gyara a kan shi, wani m shaida na wannan yanke shawara game da makomar ta."
841,And she shivered at the memory of it.,Kuma ta yi rawar jiki a kan tunãni daga gare shi.
842,"Aye!  roared in chorus the buccaneers below, and one or two of them elaborated that affirmation.","Da! roared a chorus da buccaneers kasa, kuma daya ko biyu daga cikinsu elaborated cewa tabbatarwa."
846,"In the cabin he flung into a chair, and exploded, with a violence altogether foreign to his nature.","A cikin gidan ya jefa a cikin wani kujera, kuma ya fashe, tare da wani tashin hankali gaba daya kasashen waje ga hali."
847,"I killed him, it is true.","Na kashe shi, gaskiya ne."
848,"Captain,  he said, and as he spoke he pointed to the pursuing ships,  Colonel Bishop holds us.","Ya ce, ""Kafita, kuma yayin da yake magana ya nuna jiragen ruwa da ke biye da mu, Colonel Bishop yana riƙe da mu."
849,"That'll cool Colonel Bishop's heat, maybe.","Wannan zai kwantar da hankalin Colonel Bishop, watakila."
850,Your station is on the gun-deck.,Tasharku tana kan tashar bindiga.
853,"So I heard,  she admitted in a small voice.","Sai na ji, ta yarda da shi a cikin wani karamin murya."
856,"But laugh though he might, he knew as well as Pitt that in going ashore that morning he carried his life in his hands.","Amma ko da yake ya iya dariya, ya san da kuma Pitt cewa a cikin tafiya zuwa ga tudu da safe ya dauki rayuwarsa a hannunsa."
857,I... I had not dreamed....,Ban yi mafarki ba...
859,But there is no hope for him in that!  she cried.,Amma babu bege a gare shi a cikin wannan! ta yi kuka.
864,I will take leave to doubt it.  His lordship's tone abated nothing of its asperity.,"Zan yi jinkirin yin shakka, amma sautin da ya yi bai rage ba."
865,"There was here quite plainly a vague threat, a mutinous spirit he could not understand.","A nan akwai wata barazana mai ban tsoro, wata ruhun tawaye da bai iya fahimta ba."
866,Don't be forgetting that.   Jeremy clenched his hands.,Kada ka manta da hakan. Jeremy ya yi ta matsawa.
869,But it gave no pause to the gunner's intention.,Amma hakan bai hana mai bin bindiga yin hakan ba.
870,But Blood's mind was now made up.,Amma yanzu an yanke shawarar Blood.
871,"Why, as I was just telling his lordship here, who thought like you that having Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe, not for his mother would that filthy slaver forgo what's due to him.","Kamar yadda na gaya wa ubangijinsa, wanda ya yi tunani kamar ku cewa samun Miss Bishop a kan jirgin zai sa mu zama lafiya, ba don mahaifiyarsa ba, wannan bawa mai lalata zai yi watsi da abin da ya cancanta."
872,"In his cabin on the starboard side Lord Julian, disturbed by the same sounds, was already astir and hurriedly dressing.","A cikin gidansa a gefen dama na gefen dama, Lord Julian, wanda ya damu da irin wannan sauti, ya riga ya kasance mai ban tsoro kuma yana gaggauta yin ado."
875,Let me present Captain Blood.   Perforce Bishop must put on the best face he could command.,Ka bar ni in gabatar da Captain Blood. Dole ne Bishop ya yi amfani da fuskarsa a matsayin mai kyau da zai iya yin mulki.
881,"Pitt, at his post beside the helmsman, turned intrepidly to face the excited gunner.","Pitt, a matsayinsa kusa da mai kula da jirgin, ya juya da gaba gaɗi don fuskantar mai bindiga mai farin ciki."
882,Blood leaned over the rail to speak to the fair young man immediately below him by the helmsman at the whipstaff.,Jinin ya jingina kan layin don ya yi magana da saurayi mai kyau a ƙarƙashinsa ta hanyar mai kula da jirgin a cikin whipstaff.
883,"The country is all, sir; the sovereign naught.","Ƙasar ita ce duka, sir; babu abin da yake da iko."
884,His hand closed over the butt of one of the pistols slung before him.,Hannunsa ya rufe kan ɗaya daga cikin bindigogi da aka jefa a gabansa.
886,It gives him a grievance at last.,A ƙarshe ya yi masa gunaguni.
887,"Wait!  Blood bade him, interrupting, and he set a restraining hand upon the gunner's arm.","Sai jini ya ce masa ya katse masa, sai ya sa hannu a hannun mai bindiga."
889,"And for all that he lost nothing of his outward stern composure, fear invaded his heart.","Kuma duk da cewa bai rasa kome ba daga cikin taurin zuciyarsa, tsoro ya mamaye zuciyarsa."
893,Through her and through you.,Ta wurinta da kuma ta wurinka.
894,Though we had a cargo of Bishop's nieces it wouldn't make him hold his hand.,"Ko da yake muna da 'yan uwan Bishop, ba zai sa ya riƙe hannunsa ba."
895,If now he can show that....,Idan yanzu zai iya nuna hakan...
896,That is what we were advised.,Wannan shi ne abin da aka gaya mana.
897,How?  she asked him with a sudden startled interest.,Ta tambayi shi da sha'awar da ta yi.
898,"‘Twill be a kindness, so it will.   For a moment she stood before him with quickened breathing, the colour ebbing and flowing in her cheeks.","Ta tsaya a gabansa na ɗan lokaci tare da numfashi mai sauri, launi yana gudana da gudana a cikin wuyanta."
899,He was moved to raise his voice above its usual languid level.,Ya motsa ya ɗaga muryarsa fiye da yadda yake a dā.
900,My name is Wade--Lord Julian Wade.,"Sunana Wade, Ubangiji Julian Wade."
901,"I see, sir, that you do not yet quite apprehend the circumstances.","Na ga, sir, cewa ba ka har yanzu quite apprehended yanayi."
902,"I am pressed,  she informed him.",Ta gaya masa cewa ina da damuwa.
903,"As for me,  said Lord Julian, with intent to make Miss Bishop's departure free from all interference on the part of the buccaneers,  I shall remain aboard the Arabella until we reach Port Royal.","Game da ni, in ji Lord Julian, da niyyar yin Miss Bishop ta tashi free daga duk wani tsoma baki daga bangaren buccaneers, zan zauna a kan jirgin Arabella har mu isa Port Royal."
905,"Then:   You ordered it?  he said in accents of unbelief, whilst Lord Julian raised his eyebrows.","Sai ya ce: ""Ka umurce shi?"" ya ce da muryar rashin imani, yayin da Lord Julian ya ɗaga fuskarsa."
906,Expressly.   His lordship waited a moment for a reply.,Ya jira wani lokaci don amsa.
909,"You know, Peter, that it is Lord Julian alone has stood between Bishop and his hate of you.","Ka san, Peter, cewa Ubangiji Julian ne kaɗai ya tsaya tsakanin Bishop da kuma ƙiyayya da ka."
910,"But many could not resolve one way or the other until they were satisfied upon several questions, and chiefly upon one which was voiced by Ogle.","Amma mutane da yawa ba za su iya warware wannan ko wancan hanyar ba har sai sun gamsu da tambayoyi da yawa, kuma musamman a kan daya da Ogle ya yi magana."
911,"Ye're going to deliver yourself into Bishop's hands,  Pitt warned him.",Pitt ya gargaɗe shi cewa za ka mika kanka ga Bishop.
912,"Standing beside Captain Blood, he looked astern, following the indication of the Captain's hand, and cried out in his amazement.","Tsaye kusa da Kyaftin jini, ya dubi baya, bin nunawa na Kyaftin ta hannu, kuma ya yi kuka a cikin mamaki."
913,"He may be right, and he may be wrong.","Zai iya yin gaskiya, kuma zai iya yin kuskure."
915,"But if she resented his tone and his words, she stifled her resentment.","Amma idan ta yi fushi da muryarsa da kuma kalmominsa, sai ta dakile fushi."
916,I am informed that yesterday evening a frigate left the harbour having on board your associate Wolverstone and a hundred men of the hundred and fifty that were serving under you.,An sanar da ni cewa a daren jiya wani jirgin ruwa ya bar tashar jirgin ruwa yana dauke da abokin aikinku Wolverstone da kuma mutane ɗari daga cikin ɗari da hamsin da ke aiki a ƙarƙashinku.
919,And instantly would have recalled the words had she been able.,Kuma nan take za ta tuna da kalmomin da ta iya.
920,But that it was no more than a mask for his fury and his venom was plain to all.,Amma cewa ba abin da ya fi fushinsa ba ne kuma guba ta bayyana ga kowa.
921,Levasseur?  He smiled a little.,Ya yi murmushi kaɗan.
923,"HOSTILITIES   In the great harbour of Port Royal, spacious enough to have given moorings to all the ships of all the navies of the world, the Arabella rode at anchor.","A babban tashar jiragen ruwa na Port Royal, wanda yake da sarari sosai don ya ba da ƙofar zuwa ga dukan jiragen ruwa na dukan rundunar jiragen ruwa na duniya, Arabella ta hau a kan gungumen azaba."
924,He swung to Lord Julian.,Ya yi wa Ubangiji Julian biyayya.
925,"Good-morning to you,  he said, and added  I've blundered badly, so I have.","Ya ce, ""Safiya mai kyau"", kuma ya kara da cewa, ""Na yi kuskure sosai, don haka na yi."
926,"He stepped back, a baffled, impotent man.","Ya koma baya, ya yi mamaki, ya yi rashin ƙarfi."
928,"Although even some o' they should know better, for there's still a few was on Barbados with us, and are acquainted like me and you with Colonel Bishop.","Ko da yake ko da wasu 'o' su sani mafi alhẽri, domin akwai har yanzu wasu da aka a Barbados tare da mu, kuma suna da masaniya kamar ni da ku da Colonel Bishop."
929,"Pitt, loosely clad in shirt and breeches, leaned against the rail the while and watched him, unmistakable concern imprinted on his fair, frank countenance.","Pitt, a loosely saka a cikin riguna da burs, jingina zuwa ga rails a lokacin da kuma kallo shi, m damuwa buga a kan fair, m fuskar."
930,"That'll be the signal to lie to,  said Blood, in the same listless voice; and he fetched a sigh.","Wannan zai zama siginar ya yi ƙarya ga, ya ce jini, a cikin wannan m murya; kuma ya kawo wani numfashi."
931,"And what better are these?--Are ye afeard of a lubberly Barbados planter? Whatever ails you, Peter? I've never known ye scared afore.   A gun boomed out behind them.","Kuma abin da mafi alhẽri ne wadannan? - Shin, ka ji tsoron wani lubbery Barbados shuka? abin da ya dame ka, Peter? Ban taba sani ba ka ji tsoro kafin."
932,"And a couple of miles this side of it, bearing after them, came speeding three great white ships.","Kuma a mil biyu daga wannan gefen, yana bin su, ya zo yana hanzarta manyan manyan jiragen ruwa uku."
933,"It's our only chance, I've said, and we must take it.   The better way that was in Captain Blood's mind was the way that already he had proposed to Wolverstone.","Wannan shine damarmu kawai, na ce, kuma dole ne mu yi amfani da shi."
935,The young master's grey eyes skimmed it.,Idanun maigidan ya yi ta yin ta.
936,Whether the men in the panic Ogle had aroused among them would take a different view from Wolverstone's he did not know.,Ko mutanen da ke cikin firgita Ogle ya farka a cikinsu zai dauki wani ra'ayi daban-daban daga Wolverstone ya bai sani ba.
937,"Heave her to, and signal to them to send a boat.   A silence of astonishment fell upon the ship--of astonishment and suspicion at this sudden yielding.","Heave ta zuwa, kuma siginar zuwa gare su su aika da jirgin ruwa. wani shiru na mamaki ya fadi a kan jirgin - na mamaki da kuma shakka a wannan m mika wuya."
940,I accept it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into which my own act may have brought us.,Na yarda da shi a matsayin hanya guda daya da za ta ceci mu duka daga halakar da ta kai mu ga aikina.
942,"I... I can't think why you should speak to me like this,  she said, with less than her earlier assurance.","Ba zan iya tunanin dalilin da ya sa za ku yi magana da ni kamar haka ba, ta ce, da rashin tabbacin da ta yi a baya."
943,And the quixotic fool is running into danger at the present moment on our behalf.,Kuma wannan wawa mai ban tsoro yana cikin haɗari a wannan lokacin a madadinmu.
944,"A thin, sour smile broke on the officer's haughty lips.",Murmushi mai laushi ya karya a kan leɓunan jami'in.
946,So that ye can be charitable in some ways!  He laughed softly.,"""Domin ku yi sadaka a wasu hanyoyi"". Ya yi dariya a hankali."
947,Hark to the gentleman!  he mocked.,Ya yi wa mutumin ba'a.
949,"Threats will not serve, Captain.","Barazanar ba za ta taimaka ba, Kyaftin."
950,"Captain Blood's glance raked the ranks of those resolute, fierce-eyed fellows, then it came to rest again on Ogle.","Binciken Kyaftin Blood ya ratsa kan waɗannan mutane masu ƙuduri, masu ido mai ƙarfi, sa'an nan kuma ya sake komawa Ogle."
952,"If ye're counting on pulling Bishop's heartstrings, ye're a bigger fool, Ogle, than I've always thought you was with anything but guns.","Idan kana da tabbacin ka yi wa Bishop ja-gora, kai ne babban wawa, Ogle, fiye da na yi zaton kana da kome amma bindiga."
953,"He had found the only way, and repellent though it might be to him, he must take it.","Ya sami hanya guda, kuma ko da yake zai iya zama mai ban tsoro a gare shi, dole ne ya dauki shi."
955,He threw them at me again and again.,Ya jefa su a kaina sau da sau.
956,That is: that he has been notified of the coming of Lord Julian Wade.,Wannan shi ne: cewa an sanar da shi game da zuwan Lord Julian Wade.
957,"Oh, please.  There was real alarm in her voice.",A muryarta akwai wani abin tsoro.
958,"Fearing to betray the latter, she took refuge in the former.","Domin tana tsoron cin amanar wannan, ta nemi mafaka a wurin."
959,"You take that tone! You dare to take that tone!  she cried, astounding him by her sudden vehemence.","Ta yi kuka, ta ba shi mamaki da ta gaggauta vehemence."
960,You may have heard of me.   Captain Calverley stared hard.,"Ka san ni, amma Captain Calverley ya yi ta kallon ni."
962,It isn't that.   But they were fated to misunderstand each other.,"Ba haka ba ne, amma an ƙaddara su su fahimci juna ba."
964,"If anything should happen to you, Peter,  he said, as Blood was going over the side,  Colonel Bishop had better look to himself.","Idan wani abu ya faru da kai, Peter, ya ce, yayin da jini ya wuce gefe, Colonel Bishop ya fi kyau ya duba kansa."
967,"I'll be getting my hat and cane and sword, and go ashore in the cock-boat.","Zan zo in kawo hatina da sanda da takobi, kuma in hau bakin teku a cikin jirgin ruwan."
968,"I must return to Colonel Bishop for my orders,  he informed them.","Dole ne in koma wurin Kolonel Bishop domin in karɓi umarni, ya sanar da su."
969,In a flash Captain Blood saw what was in their minds.,A cikin wani haske Captain Blood ya ga abin da suke tunani.
970,"I do my best,  said she.",Ta ce ina yin iyakar ƙoƙarina.
971,"Oh, but--by your leave--surely there is nothing to be apprehended from Colonel Bishop.","Oh, amma - da izininka - lalle ne, akwai wani abu da za a kama daga Colonel Bishop."
972,"I wonder, now,  he said presently,  if the mischief is of your working.","Ina mamaki, yanzu, ya ce a yanzu, idan da mugunta ne daga aikinka."
973,"Shrewd advocacy,  he approved it.",Ya amince da shi don ya ba da shawara mai kyau.
975,"I have something to show you.   Wondering, Lord Julian mounted the companion as he was bidden.","Ina da wani abu da zan nuna maka, ina mamakin yadda Lord Julian ya hau kan sahabbansa kamar yadda aka umurce shi."
976,"Before we've run another half-mile we shall be within range.   Wolverstone swore elaborately, then suddenly checked.","Kafin mu sake gudu da mil mil, za mu kasance a cikin nesa."
977,He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.,Yana da kirki har zuwa wauta.
978,He levelled his telescope upon that figure.,Ya daidaita telescope a kan wannan adadi.
979,"Miss Bishop was aboard the Royal Mary also, and I rescued her together with his lordship.","Miss Bishop kuma yana cikin Royal Mary, kuma na cece ta tare da ubangijinsa."
980,What if he can?  Blood interrupted carelessly.,"Idan ya iya, sai ya katse jini ba tare da ya kula ba."
981,"I'll rot in hell or ever I serves the King,  he bawled in a great rage.","Zan ruɓe a jahannama ko kuma duk lokacin da na bauta wa Sarki, ya yi kuka cikin fushi mai girma."
982,"Ye're surely daft even to think of it, Peter!","Lalle ne kai wawa ne, har ma da ka yi tunani game da shi, Peter!"
983,"Standing now at the rail, with Lord Julian beside him, Captain Blood explained himself.","A yanzu yana tsaye a kan layin, tare da Lord Julian a gefensa, Kyaftin Blood ya bayyana kansa."
984,"A boat that had approached unnoticed from the shore came scraping and bumping against the great red hull of the Arabella, and a raucous voice sent up a hailing shout.","Wani jirgin ruwa da ya kusanci ba a lura daga bakin teku ya zo scraping da kuma buga da babban ja jirgin ruwan na Arabella, da kuma wani murya mai ƙarfi ya aika up wani hailing kuka."
986,"Ye'll remember afterwards that it was your hardness drove me.   She moved to depart, then checked, and faced him again.","Za ka tuna daga baya cewa ta kasance da taurin kai da ya motsa ni. ta motsa don tashi, sa'an nan kuma duba, kuma ya sake fuskantar shi."
987,"Faith, you explain yourself after a fashion,  said he.","Faith, ka bayyana kanka a cikin fashion, ya ce."
988,"A drinker of blood, he is.",Yana shan jini.
989,"It's the truth, you fool.","Gaskiya ce, kai wawa."
