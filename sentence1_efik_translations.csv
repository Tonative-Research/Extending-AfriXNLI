289,care about how the national news affects the local area,Kere aban̄a nte mbụk idụt otụkde obio nnyịn.
295,but no we usually you know skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is is what you see down here so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants,"Edi idịghe ntre, nnyịn imesịne, afo ọmọfiọk, sket ye sket ye blaus m̀mê sut m̀mê ọfọñidem edi se ẹsikụtde mi, ntre enem mi ndinam utom ke ufọk koro mmekeme ndisịne ntaha-ukot."

311,but on the other hand we've eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and turtle all kinds of,"Edi ke edem efen, imọkọmọdia ata uwak raccoon ye possum ye ikid, ye kpukpru oruk n̄kpọ ntre."
313,one of the benefits we get of course is travel,"Kiet ke otu mme ufọn emi nnyịn isibọde, ke akpanikọ, edi isan̄."
320,it's it's really bad it uh i,"Edi edi ọdiọk eti eti, enye mmm ami."
322,yeah it was pretty reasonable,"Mmọñ, ama ọfọn ke ufọt ufọt."

326,have you read The Firm,ese okot The Firm

330,i don't know coming from Texas you're probably i don't know i i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think,"Mfiọkke, sia oto Texas edi, eyedi afo... mfiọkke... n̄kpanamke ndammana ekikere, edi ekeme edi ẹsịn esịt ke ndikara un̄wana ekọn̄ eti eti do, n̄kerede."
331,uh-huh oh she's great she's you know she's a character she'll sit with anybody she'll play with anybody,"Mmh, oh enye ọfọn etieti. Enye edi owo n̄kpọ, afo ọmọfiọk. Eyetie ye owo ekededi, eyebre mbre ye owo ekededi."
333,course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and steal and sell it just because they can't they can't work anymore you know,"Ọfọn̄ọ, oro ekeme ndinam idiọkn̄kpọ ọkọri, ọmọfiọk, ndien mme owo ẹdụk ẹkeyịp television fo, ẹyịp enye ẹnyụn̄ ẹnyam, sụk koro mmọ ikemeke aba ndinam utom, mmọ ikemeke, ọmọfiọk."
339,yeah they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time,"Mmọñ, mmọ ẹma ẹnyene ata ediwak n̄kpọ emi ẹketiede nte ẹbụn̄ọ ke ini kiet."
342,but uh so you like different foods huh,"Edi mm, ntre afo ama nsio nsio udia, nte?"
344,uh-huh how do you feel the newspapers there in Colorado Springs treats local interest news,"Mmh, nso ke afo ekere aban̄a nte mme n̄wedmbụk oro ke Colorado Springs ẹnamde n̄kpọ ye mbụk n̄kpọ emi enemde mbon obio esịt?"
346,you know one other benefit that that just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in  sometimes big companies will pay for like education,"Afo ọmọfiọk, ufọn en̄wen kiet emi ọkọfọnọde mi ke esịt idahaemi, n̄kọdọhọ nda ufọn esie ntre, ke nsụhọde n̄kaha, n̄kanamke kan̄a, ke ndusụk ini mme akamba company ẹsikpe ẹnọ n̄kpọ nte n̄wed."
347,well why don't you start because you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind,"Ọfọn-o, nso kpa nte afo ọtọn̄ọde, koro ama enyene ini akan ndikere mban̄a enye, edieke mûfịnake."
348,um-hum do you find that you're uh  uh disappointed or pleased with uh uh the performance of like network coverage of news,"Mmh, ndi esit esinem fi m̀mê esit esitịmede fi ye nte network esinamde utom kaban̄a mbụk?"
351,yeah i don't yeah well what get's me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes,"Eeh, n̄kwe, eeh, ọfọn, se itịmerede mi esịt, afo ọmọfiọk, n̄kpọ emi ama ọduọ ke n̄kan ke December emi ekebede ke vote ifan̄? Ke vote ikie ifan̄ kpọt."
352,oh um no but they do have hay horse races  at the Oaklawn tracks,"O o, mm, iyayi, edi mmọ ẹsinam ubiat enan̄-mbakara ke Oaklawn tracks."
353,but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good,"edi mmọfiọk nte ke ndusụk, mmọfiọk ke ediwak obio-in̄wan̄, mmọ ifọnke ntre."
355,right they will go through the slot,"Ọfọn, mmọ ẹyesan̄a ẹbe ke ekpri uwọrọ oro."
356,is it twenty percent interest,Ndi udọrọ edịp ke itie ikie?
358,now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog that's a deterrent because they know that that dog's going to bark,"Idahaemi, kiet ke otu nti n̄kpọ ndida n̄kpan owo n̄wo edi mbọhọidụn̄ eke etiede uyo; idem ọkpọkọm mbọhọidụn̄ oro enyene ebua eke etiede uyo, oro edi n̄kpọ un̄kpan, koro mmọ ẹfiọk ẹte ke ebua oro ayabọp."
359,uh-huh it's funny and um i i guess i just like funny shows mostly,"Mm-hm, anam nsahi, ndien, m̀m, n̄kerede ke mma sụk ima unedịm nsahi akpan akpan."
365,i don't know  okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening,"Mfiọkke. Ọfọn. Edi ama enem ndineme ye afo, ndien mbubreyo ọfọn ye afo."

375,it's only getting worse exponentially it seems um,"Nte etiede, enye akam ọdọdiọk ke n̄kan̄ n̄kan̄ usọp, mmm."

843,"You're not very civil, sir, as I have already noticed.","Afo udughe owo eti ido eti-eti, Ette, nte mma n̄kụt."

867,Mine is the safe and easy way.,Ekem edi usụn̄ ifụre ye mfefere.

873,And who the devil may you be?  he exploded at last.,"“Ndien, anie keedi afo ke enyịn̄ Abasi?” enye ama ofiori ke akpatre."
874,Colder still and more distant than ever grew his lordship's voice.,"Uyo ubọn̄ esie ama ọkọri ọsọn̄ akan, onyụn̄ ọyọhọ akan nte akanam mîdịghe."
876,"Steady, Old Wolf! Steady!  Captain Blood admonished him.","Sọsọñọ idem, Akani Ikpọñ! Sọsọñọ idem! Captain Blood ama ọkọbọ enye."
877,Out of the tail of his single eye he had espied a trim figure in grey silk that was ascending the companion.,"Ke nsɔñ enyịn esie kiet, enye ama okụt owo kiet emi eyede, emi esịnede ọfọñ silk ntụhọ ntụhọ, emi ọkọdọkde step ụgbọmmọn̄."

879,And that was practically the end of the matter.,Ndien oro ekedi nte ededi utịt ikọ oro.
880,‘Swounds! Perhaps you'll explain yourself? Whither has Wolverstone gone?,Mbọk Abasi! Ekeme edi afo ayanam idemfo an̄wan̄a? M̀mọ̀n̄ ke Wolverstone aka?
885,"Since when have you commanded on the main deck, Ogle? I take my orders from the Captain.","Ọtọn̄ọde ini ewe ke afo akara ke atasakpa itie ubom, Ogle? Mmọbọhọ item mi nto Ete Ubom."
888,There's no heaving to for such a matter as that unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk.,"Idụhe ndida ụgbọ ke itie kiet ke ntak utọ n̄kpọ nte oro, ibọhọke edi ke afo oyom ndinam nnyịn itịm ke nnennen."
890,But Wolverstone would not stop.,Edi Wolverstone iketreke.

892,"If it is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission, the mistake is not mine.","Edieke edide ndudue ndinọ Captain Blood iwetutom, ndudue oro idịghe okịm."
904,"Besides, how could their staying have helped me?  And as Pitt did not answer him:  Ye see?  he said, and shrugged.","Ṅko-ṅko, nditie mmọ̄ ekpekeṅwam mi didie? Ndien nte Pitt mîkọbọrọke enye ikọ: Mbufo ẹkụt? enye ọkọdọhọ, onyụṅ emenede afara."
907,But it'll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you.,Edi abaña Akamba Ikpọñ ke edidi se enye oyomde ndikụt fi.
908,"I can't think that it would make the least difference if he did,  said his lordship gravely.","""N̄kpekemeke ndikere nte oro akpakanamde nsio nsio ndomokiet, edieke enye akanamde,"" ọbọn̄ ọkọdọhọ ke n̄kpaidem."
914,Your words have rankled with him.,Ikọ fo ọmọnam enye ofụt esịt.
917,"England's,  she corrected him in reproof.","'Eke England,' enye ama ọdiọn̄ọ enye ke nditọhọ."
918,But I suspect this gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused.,"Edi n̄kere ke uko emi ekedi n̄kpọ ufari, ke idak emi Ọbọñ Julian akakamade imam ke ndịbe."
922,I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of granting the King's commission to such a man as this against all my counsels.,"Mmedori enyịn ke Ọbọñ mi, ke akpatre, ọtọn̄ọ ndikụt ndisịme ndinọ iwakutom Edidem nnọ utọ owo nte emi, owoho ke kpukpru item mi."
927,"Ah, now, can't ye, indeed?  he cried.","Ah, idahaemi, afo umemeke-o, ke akpanikọ? enye ama ọkọm."
934,"Some o' them dawcocks may believe that tale.  He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist, whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle.","Ndusụk mme ndisịme owo oro ẹkeme ndinịm mbụk oro.

938,If anything it increased his excitement.,"Edieke n̄kpọ ededi, akam ọkọri idara esie."
939,"Then let them know that if they attempt to hinder our sailing hence, we'll hang the doxy first and fight for it after.","Ndien yak mmọ ẹfiọk ẹte ke edieke mmọ ẹdomode ndikpan nnyịn ndisan̄a ke mmọn̄ nto mi, ke nnyịn iyokoi n̄wan iban̄ oro mbemiso, inyụn̄ in̄wana iban̄a enye ke ukperedem."
941,"Good-day to you, sir,  Blood hailed him pleasantly.","Emesiere nọ fi, Ete, Blood ama ọkọm enye ke inem."

2305,"Besides, their concept of time is circular, not linear, so marking the passage of time is not as important as celebrating the return of seasonal events.","Ke adianade ye oro, ekikere mmọ kaban̄a ini ọkọrọ ọwọrọ, idịghe nte en̄wan̄; ntre, ndinịm udomo ke mbe-ini idịghe akpan n̄kpọ nte ndidara edifiak edemede mme n̄kpọ ndap ini."

2310,"As for challenges, I am currently looking for a word that can be cut into two successively smaller forms.","Mban̄a mme un̄wana, mmoyom ikọ kiet idahaemi emi ẹkemede ndisio n̄wedn̄wed mfep ke esịt esie utịm iba ke edem edem, ndien ke kpukpru ini, enye an̄wan akan."
2312,"To put the matter differently, I could write an essay called  The Perils of Literacy  or  A Little Literacy Is a Dangerous Thing.","Nte ẹkpetịn̄de ikọ emi ke usụn̄ en̄wen, n̄kpekeme ndiwet n̄wed ibuotikọ emi ẹkotde 'Mme Afanikọn̄ Ediwn̄wed' m̀mê 'Ekpri Ediwn̄wed Edi Afanikọn̄ N̄kpọ'."
