868,"Her presence at this moment, and considering the nature of his altercation with Wolverstone, was embarrassing.","Kasancewarta a wannan lokacin, kuma la'akari da yanayin rikici da Wolverstone, abin kunya ne."

874,Colder still and more distant than ever grew his lordship's voice.,Ko da yake sanyi da kuma mafi nisa fiye da taba girma da Ubangiji murya.

878,No.  Blood closed his telescope.,"A'a, jini ya rufe telescope."
879,And that was practically the end of the matter.,Kuma hakan ya kawo ƙarshen batun.
880,‘Swounds! Perhaps you'll explain yourself? Whither has Wolverstone gone?,"Don haka, ka yi tunani a kan abin da ya faru a lokacin da ka yi magana da shi."
885,"Since when have you commanded on the main deck, Ogle? I take my orders from the Captain.","Tun yaushe kake yin aiki a kan babban jirgin, Ogle?"

892,"If it is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission, the mistake is not mine.","Idan kuskure ne a ba da kwamishinan ga Kyaftin Blood, to ba ni ba ne."
904,"Besides, how could their staying have helped me?  And as Pitt did not answer him:  Ye see?  he said, and shrugged.","Bugu da ƙari, yadda za su zauna ya taimake ni? Kuma kamar yadda Pitt bai amsa masa: ""Kun gani?"" ya ce, kuma shrugged."
907,But it'll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you.,Amma zai kasance game da Tsohon Wolf cewa yana so ya gan ka.
908,"I can't think that it would make the least difference if he did,  said his lordship gravely.","Ba zan iya tunanin cewa zai yi bambanci idan ya yi, ya ce da ubangijinsa tsanani."
914,Your words have rankled with him.,Kalmominka sun sa shi baƙin ciki.
917,"England's,  she corrected him in reproof.","A Ingila, ta gyara shi a cikin gyara."
918,But I suspect this gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused.,Amma ina tsammanin wannan nauyi ne ga abin rufe fuska wanda a karkashinsa aka yi wa Lord Julian nishaɗi a asirce.
922,I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of granting the King's commission to such a man as this against all my counsels.,Ina fata ubangijinku ya fahimci wauta na ba da umarnin sarki ga irin wannan mutum a kan shawarata.
927,"Ah, now, can't ye, indeed?  he cried.","Ah, yanzu, ba za ka iya, da gaske? ya yi kuka."
934,"Some o' them dawcocks may believe that tale.  He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist, whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle.","Wasu daga cikin 'da' cock zai yi imani da cewa labarin. ya jũyar da wani m yatsa zuwa ga maza a cikin bel, wanda rankings aka kullum kara da zuwan wasu daga gaban castle."

941,"Good-day to you, sir,  Blood hailed him pleasantly.","Barka da zuwa, sir, jini ya yi masa murna."
945,"Don't you, by God! And what else do you call this? But as His Majesty's Deputy-Governor of Jamaica, I'll take leave to correct your mistake in my own way.","Amma a matsayina na mataimakin gwamnan Jamaica, zan ba da izinin gyara kuskuren ka a hanyata."
948,"So ye've come,  the Deputy-Governor hailed him, and followed the greeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill-humoured import.","Saboda haka kun zo, Mataimakin Gwamna ya yaba masa, kuma ya bi gaisuwa ta hanyar jerin murmushi na rashin fahimta amma a fili ba shi da kyau."
951,"That girl, there.  He flung out a bare arm to point to her.","Wannan yarinyar, a can, ya jefa hannunsa a waje don ya nuna mata."
