He stared at her open-mouthed.,"Ufite uburakari bwo kuncyaha kuko ntazakureka ngo nkufate mu biganza, ubwo nzi ko byanduye, kandi nzi ko uri umwicanyi kandi ko ari mubi kurushaho."

832,"Life can be infernally complex,  he sighed.","Yarashubije ati ""ubuzima bushobora kuba burangwa n'imbogamizi nyinshi."
833,"Wolverstone squared himself defiantly before his captain   I'll see Colonel Bishop in hell or ever I lies to for him.  And he spat, presumably for purposes of emphasis.","Wolverstone yemeye ko umukuru w'abasirikare we amuhora imbere, maze aramusuka, wenda kugira ngo ashimangire."
836,"I... I believe that he has,  said Calverley, between doubt and suspicion.",Calverley yavuze ko afite ikibazo cyo gushidikanya no gushidikanya.

843,"You're not very civil, sir, as I have already noticed.","Nta bwo uri umuntu w'umunyacyubahiro, nk'uko nabibonye."
844,"Wait!  He swung back to face the Captain, who had placed a hand on is shoulder and was smiling, a trifle wistfully.","Yagarutse asanga Kapiteni wari umaze kumushyiraho ukuboko, maze aseka, ariko ari mu bwigunge."
845,"He looked up in surprise, and then sat conning her with brooding glance.","Yaramutunguye, maze yicara amwitegereza."

855,There's a thorn or two left on me.  And with a laugh Blood departed to his cabin.,"Hariho ihwa rimwe cyangwa abiri yasigaye ku mutwe wanjye, maze Blood aseka cyane ajya mu nzu ye."
858,"Believe me, I am very grateful.","Mwireme, ndabashimira cyane."

861,That was in Bridgetown on the night of the Spanish raid.,Ibyo byabaye i Bridgetown mu ijoro ry'igitero cy'Abesipanyoli.
862,"Blood broke the seal, and read.","Amaraso yavunitse ihembe, maze arasoma."
863,"In that garden's main avenue, that was fringed with palm and sandalwood, he had caught sight of Miss Bishop alone.","Mu muhanda mukuru wo muri ubwo busitani wari wuzuyemo ibiti by'imikindo n'ibiti by'amasanduku, yari yarabonye Miss Bishop wenyine."
867,Mine is the safe and easy way.,Uburyo bworoshye kandi bworoshye ni ubwacu.
868,"Her presence at this moment, and considering the nature of his altercation with Wolverstone, was embarrassing.","Kuba yari ahari muri icyo gihe, kandi iyo umuntu yazirikanaga ukuntu yavuganye na Wolverstone, byaramukojeje isoni."
873,And who the devil may you be?  he exploded at last.,"Kandi se, ni nde mu by'ukuri waba uri?"
874,Colder still and more distant than ever grew his lordship's voice.,Ijwi ry'Umwami ryaje gukomera cyane kandi rirushaho kuba kure.
876,"Steady, Old Wolf! Steady!  Captain Blood admonished him.","Uwakoraga ibyo byose, ni we wari umutegetsi w'igihugu."
877,Out of the tail of his single eye he had espied a trim figure in grey silk that was ascending the companion.,"Mu ijisho rimwe gusa, yari yararebye mu maso he umuntu wari ufite isura y'umukandara w'umukara, wari ugiye kuzamuka."
878,No.  Blood closed his telescope.,"Oya, amaraso yafunze terelesikopi ye."
879,And that was practically the end of the matter.,Icyo gihe ibintu byari birangiye.
880,‘Swounds! Perhaps you'll explain yourself? Whither has Wolverstone gone?,Ese ushobora gusobanura aho Wolverstone yagiye?
885,"Since when have you commanded on the main deck, Ogle? I take my orders from the Captain.","Ni ryari uhagarariye ku kibuga cy'indege, Ogle?"
888,There's no heaving to for such a matter as that unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk.,"Nta kintu cyo kwiyamamaza kirimo icyo, keretse niba wifuza kumenya neza ko tuzamererwa nabi."
890,But Wolverstone would not stop.,Ariko Wolverstone ntiyahagaritse.
891,He beheld himself to be as the dog in the fable that had dropped the substance to snatch at a delusive shadow.,Yumvaga ameze nk'imbwa yo mu nkuru y'ibinyoma yari yarasize icyo kintu kugira ngo agikure mu gicucu cy'urukozasoni.
892,"If it is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission, the mistake is not mine.","Niba gutanga komisiyo kuri Kapiteni Blood ari ikosa, si jye ugize ikosa."
904,"Besides, how could their staying have helped me?  And as Pitt did not answer him:  Ye see?  he said, and shrugged.","Kandi se, ni gute kuba baragumye byamfashije? kandi Pitt ntiyamushubije ati: ""Murabona? "" aravuga, maze ahita ashyira ibipfukamiro."
907,But it'll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you.,Ariko azashaka kukubona bitewe n'uko ari we Mbisi y'Imyaka.
908,"I can't think that it would make the least difference if he did,  said his lordship gravely.","Sinumva ko byari kugira icyo bitangaho niba yarabigenje atyo, Umwami w'Ikirenga yavuze mu buryo bukomeye."
914,Your words have rankled with him.,Amagambo yawe yamurakariye cyane.
917,"England's,  she corrected him in reproof.","Ni mu Bwongereza, kandi yamugiriye inama."
918,But I suspect this gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused.,Ariko ndatekereza ko ibyo ari ikimenyetso cy'uko Umwami Julian yari yarishimye mu ibanga.
922,I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of granting the King's commission to such a man as this against all my counsels.,"Nizere ko Umwami wanyu azabasha kubona ubupfapfa bwo guha umwami inshingano z'umuntu nk'uyu, binyuranyije n'inama zanjye zose."
927,"Ah, now, can't ye, indeed?  he cried.","Ah, none, ntimubasha, koko?"
934,"Some o' them dawcocks may believe that tale.  He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist, whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle.","Hari bamwe mu bantu bari muri iyo nzu bashobora kwemera iyo nkuru. Yafashe intoki y'umuntu mu buryo bw'agasuzuguro, yerekeza ku bantu bari mu kibuno, abo bari barushijeho kwiyongera bitewe n'uko abandi bari baturutse mu kigo cy'imbere."
938,If anything it increased his excitement.,Ibyo byatumaga arushaho kwishima.
939,"Then let them know that if they attempt to hinder our sailing hence, we'll hang the doxy first and fight for it after.","Hanyuma, ujye ubamenyesha ko niba bashaka kutubuza kugenda, tubanza kuzamurika iyo ndege hanyuma tukayirwanirira."
941,"Good-day to you, sir,  Blood hailed him pleasantly.","Mugire umunsi mwiza, mwami."
945,"Don't you, by God! And what else do you call this? But as His Majesty's Deputy-Governor of Jamaica, I'll take leave to correct your mistake in my own way.","Ariko nk'icyubahiro cy'Umwami w'Ikirenga, nzemera gukosora ikosa ryanyu mu buryo bwanjye."
948,"So ye've come,  the Deputy-Governor hailed him, and followed the greeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill-humoured import.","Ubwo rero mwaje, Visi Guverineri yaramusingije, maze akurikizaho kumuramutsa akoresheje amagambo menshi atumvikana ariko asa n'aho adafite ishema."
951,"That girl, there.  He flung out a bare arm to point to her.","Uwo mukobwa, aho ngaho, yajugunye ukuboko kumwerekezaho."
954,"Aye,  said Ogle,  that is true.   But there were some who were still in open and frank revolt against the course.","Ogle yaravuze ati ""ni byo koko, ariko hari bamwe bari bakomeje kwigomeka ku buryo bugaragara."
961,"What I think of you can be a very little matter to you, sir.   This was a disarming stroke.","Ibyo ntekereza kuri wowe bishobora kuba ari ibintu byoroheje cyane, monsieur."
963,I'll not be bubbled by what Wolverstone has said.,Ibyo Wolverstone yavuze ntibizatuma ntwarwa n'agahinda.
965,"About him in the waist, where all last night had been so peaceful, there was a frenziedly active bustle of some threescore men.","Ku bihereranye na we mu kibuno, aho ijoro ryakeye ryose ryari ryararuhutse cyane, habayeho urusaku rw'abantu bagera kuri mirongo itatu na batatu."
966,"I cannot think why you should trouble to put yourself on your defence,   she discouraged him.","Sinzi impamvu wagombye guhangayika ukirinda, yamwicaje intege."
974,"Bid them take in sail, Jeremy,  he said quietly.","Yabwiye Jeremy ati ""Ubwire abantu bajye ku bwato""."
985,"You'll not go?  he said, between question and assertion.","Yaramubwiye ati ""ntukigendere hagati y'ikibazo n'ikiganiro""."
991,"He sought comfort in a line on the open page before him:     levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere est nefas.   Sought it, but hardly found it.",Yashatse ihumure mu murongo wo ku ipaji yafungutse imbere ye: levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere est nefas.
992,"For myself, I am entirely of Wolverstone's opinion.","Ku bwanjye, nemera ibitekerezo bya Wolverstone."
994,See it manned for me.,Reka mbone uko mbikoresha.
998,"He stopped short at sight of Captain Blood, and saluted him, as was his due, but the smile that lifted the officer's stiff mostachios was grimly sardonic.","Yarahagaritse gato igihe yabonaga Kapiteni Blood, maze aramuramutsa, nk'uko byari bikwiriye, ariko urwenya rwatumye umukozi areka kurya cyane rwari rurangwa n'urwenya."
