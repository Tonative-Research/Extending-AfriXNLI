907,But it'll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you.,"Kata kamano, obiro dwaro neni nikech wach Ochun."
908,"I can't think that it would make the least difference if he did,  said his lordship gravely.","""Ok anyal paro ni ne nyalo bedo gima ber ka en ema otimo kamano"", Ruoth nowacho gi gero."
914,Your words have rankled with him.,Weche ma ne iwachone ne ochwanye.
917,"England's,  she corrected him in reproof.",England ne orieye mondo okonye.
918,But I suspect this gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused.,"Kata kamano, aparo ni mano ne en mana gima ne miyo Ruoth Julian bedo mamor."
922,I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of granting the King's commission to such a man as this against all my counsels.,"Ageno ni Ruoth koro osefwenyo ni ok en gima nyiso rieko ka imiyo ng'at ma kamano migawo mar bedo ruoth, to ok amiye rieko."
927,"Ah, now, can't ye, indeed?  he cried.","Noywak niya, ""Ok unyal timo kamano adier?"
934,"Some o' them dawcocks may believe that tale.  He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist, whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle.","Jomoko kuomgi nyalo yie gi wachno, to kata kamano, ne oting'o lith lwete kochomo joma ne ni e korgi, ma kwan-gi ne medore mos mos nikech jolweny mamoko ma ne wuok e nyimgi."

941,"Good-day to you, sir,  Blood hailed him pleasantly.","Odiechieng' maber, sir, Blood norwake maber."
945,"Don't you, by God! And what else do you call this? But as His Majesty's Deputy-Governor of Jamaica, I'll take leave to correct your mistake in my own way.","To kaka jalup ruoth ma en jalup gavana mar Jamaica, abiro kawo rusa mondo alos kethoni e yo mara awuon."
948,"So ye've come,  the Deputy-Governor hailed him, and followed the greeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill-humoured import.","Omiyo, ne ubiro, jalup gavana ne omose, kendo bang'e ne orwake gi weche mang'eny ma ne ok nyis ni ne en gi chuny maber."
951,"That girl, there.  He flung out a bare arm to point to her.","Nyako ma kanyo, ne oting'o bade mondo onyise kama entie."
954,"Aye,  said Ogle,  that is true.   But there were some who were still in open and frank revolt against the course.","Ogle nowacho ni en adier, kata kamano, ne nitie jomoko ma ne pod kwedo puonjno."
