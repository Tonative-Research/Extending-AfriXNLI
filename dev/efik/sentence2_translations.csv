2366,Keeping him up at night was the fact that he accepted the King's commission.,Se ikedịbede enye idap ke okoneyo ekedi nte enye ọkọbọde utom Edidem.
2367,The King's commission was a very prestigious title with many responsibilities.,Utom Edidem ekedi ata akamba itie ukpono ye ediwak mbiomo.

2372,"I received some news before sending for you, Captain Blood.","Mma mbɔ ndusụk mbụk mbemiso n̄kọdọn̄ọde ẹkot fi, Captain Blood."
2373,The news I received shocked me to the core.,Mbụk emi n̄kọbọde ama enyek mi esịt etieti.
2377,Her composure looked unnatural because she had a backache,"Uko idem esie iketịmke itie nte ekesitiede, koro enye ama ọdọn̄ọ ubiak edem."
2378,"She didn't ask anything, she told him to get out.","Enye ikọbụpke n̄kpọ, ọkọdọhọ enye ọwọrọ."
2379,"She was dressed in white when she asked: Why do you run, then?.",Enye ama esịne ọfọñ afia ke ini enye okobụpde ete: Ntak emi afo ọfefen̄ede do?

2388,Ogle was angry.,Ogle ama ayat esit.
2398,He has never imagined grasping me.,Enye akananam ikereke ndimụm mi.
2399,He thinks grabbing me will be really simple.,Enye ekere ke ndimụm mi eyedi ata mfefere.
2400,I may not be as easy to grab as he thinks.,Ami ndikemeke ndidi mmemmem ndimụm nte enye ekerede.
2404,I accept it willingly.,Ami nyịme ye unyịme esịt.
2405,"I am not willing to accept it, but I could be convinced.","Nnyịmeke ndinyịme enye, edi ẹkeme ndimen mi esịt."
2406,I don't accept it willingly.,Ami nnyịmeke enye ke ima esịt.
2407,"After a pause he said a murderer, I.","Ke edem usịnenyịn, enye ọkọdọhọ ete: Owo uwotowo—kpa ami."
2408,He hadn't murdered anyone.,Enye ikọwọtkọ baba owo kiet.
2409,"Immediately he said, A murderer, I.","Ke ndondo oro enye ọdọhọ, Owo uwotowo, ami ndi."

2458,The woman had had enough of their bad behavior.,"N̄wan oro, esịt ama ọyọhọ enye ye idiọk ido mmọ."
2459,The woman was angry and defensive.,"N̄wan oro ama ayat esịt, onyụn̄ ọbọrọ idem."
2460,The woman was so delighted that she was speechless!,"N̄wan oro ama adat esịt etieti, tutu ikọ okụk enye ke inua!"
2476,"He did not ask any questions, since he knew he had picked the best way.","Enye ikọbọpke mbụme, koro ama ọfiọk ke ama emek mfọnn̄kan usụn̄."
2477,He wanted to know if there was a better way.,Enye akoyom ndifiọk m̀mê odu usụn̄ efen emi ọfọnde akan.
2478,He was convinced that he had chosen the best way.,Enye ama enịm ke akpanikọ ke imọ ama emek usụn̄ emi ọfọnde akan.
2488,"He rose promptly, and proceeded to pull Lord Julian up to his feet.","Enye ama adaha ke usọp usọp, onyụn̄ ama ọtọn̄ọ ndidụri Ọbọn̄ Julian ada ke ukot."
2489,"He was feeling very tired, so he did not stand up.","Enye ama okop idem emem etieti, ntre ikedaha ke enyọn̄."
2490,"Lord Julian rose, showing good manners, but he did not bother standing.","Ọbọñ Julian ama edemere, owụtde eti ido, edi enye ikọbọhọke ndinen̄ede nda."
2494,He let out a sign of resignation.,Enye ama ọduọk idịbi utreuyo.
2495,He remained silent as he complained about the simplicity of life.,Enye ama osụhọde idop nte enye ekesemede aban̄a mmemmem uwem.
2496,Life is infernally complicated because of the many interactions one might have.,"Uwem edi afanikọn̄ etieti, ke ntak ediwak n̄kpọndịbe oro owo ekemede ndinyene."
2497,Colonel Bishop has done something to make Wolverstone his enemy.,Colonel Bishop ama anam n̄kpọ ndinam Wolverstone edi asuwa esie.
2498,He spit on the ground in an effort to emphasize his point.,Enye ama ọtọñọ ntọi ke isọñ man owụt ke ikọ esie edi akpanikọ.
2499,Wolverstone and Colonel Bishop were close friends.,Wolverstone ye Colonel Bishop ẹma ẹdi n̄kpọ́ n̄kpọ́ ufan.
2506,Calverly responded in a way that made him seem like he was on-the-fence about something.,Calverly ama ọbọrọ ke usụn̄ emi akanamde enye etie nte n̄kpọ ikan̄wan̄ake enye idem aban̄a n̄kpọ kiet.
2507,Calverly was only indecisive in his answer because he did not know all of the facts.,Calverly ekedi mfịghe-mfịghe ke ibọrọ esie ikpọn̄ koro enye ikefiọkke kpukpru un̄wọn̄ọ ikọ.
2508,"Cleverly spoke with clear decisiveness, knowing that he has with certainty.","Ama etịn̄ ikọ ke ọniọn̄ ye ubiere-ikọ emi an̄wan̄ade, sia ọkọfiọkde ete enye enyene ke ata-mfọni."
2509,He has his own officers.,Enye enyene mme owo ukara esie.
2510,He is alone and has no officers.,"Enye odu ikpọn̄, ndien inyeneke mbonutom."
2511,His officers respect him.,Mme owo ukara esie ẹkpono enye.
2512,"She did not want him to help her, though was grateful anyway.","Enye ikoyomke enye an̄wam imọ, edi ama osọbọ kpa ye oro."

2527,The man is acting uncivilized.,Erenowo oro anam nkpo mbufi.

2531,He was looking away from the Captain and then turned around to see him.,"Enye ekesede n̄kan̄ en̄wen ọkpọn̄ Captain, ndien ama afiak edem ndise enye."

2555,He spent 2 weeks in Port Royal.,Enye ama odu urua iba ke Port Royal.
2556,He was doing repairs on his ship.,Enye ekesinam mme edidiọn̄ ke ubom esie.
2560,The man was the captain of one of the ships.,Erenowo oro ekedi ọbọñ-ụgbọ ke kiet ke mme ụgbọ mmọñ.
2561,There was a fleet of ships.,Ama odu udịm nsụn̄ikan̄.
2562,There were no ships in sight.,Ikenyeneke ufọk-mmọn̄ ke enyịn.
2563,Blood had been inside his cabin.,Iyịp ama okodu ke esịt ufọk esie.
2564,Blood was laughing because he was joyful.,Blood ama asak koro enye ama enem esịt.
2565,Blood was scowling.,Iyịp ama enyịn̄ enyịn̄.
2572,I am definitely ungrateful to you.,Ami ndi owo esịt ibọhọke nnọ fi ke akpanikọ.
2573,I am grateful because you had done a lot for me.,Esɔsɔn̄ọ mi koro afo ama ọkọnam uwak n̄kpọ nnọ mi.
2574,One is certainly grateful.,Owo ọkọm ke akpanikọ.
2578,It has always been a contest ever since we went about.,Ama esidi ubịat kpukpru ini toto ke ini ikasan̄ade n̄kpọ.
2579,The race had begun ever since we were four.,Ufọp ama ọkọtọn̄ọ toto ke ini nnyịn ikedide isua inan̄.
2580,There was never any race to begin with.,Akananam ubiat ndomokiet ikidụhe toto ke ntọn̄ọ.
2581,People were killed in the Spanish raid.,Mme owo ẹma ẹbọ uwot ke nsobo mbon Spain.

2586,The seal was broken.,N̄kpọ-n̄kịbi oro ama abụn̄.

2588,Miss Bishop went to the garden in order to contemplate her life.,Ọbọñwañ Bishop ama aka ke inwañ man etie ekere abaña uwem esie.
2589,There was absolutely no one at the garden whatsoever.,Baba owo kiet ikọdụhọ ke in̄wan̄ ndomo.
2599,My way is the most difficult.,Usụn̄ mi edi ata ọkpọsọn̄.
2600,Someone else's way is difficult.,Usụn̄ owo en̄wen ọsọn̄.
2601,There is a way that is safe and easy.,Enyene usụn̄ emi ọfọnde ifụre ye mfefere.
2602,She quickly fled the scene in order to avoid further scrutiny.,Enye ama ọsọp efehe ọkpọn̄ ebiet oro man efep ndụn̄ọde efen.
2603,The fact that she was here after the fight with Wolverstone was considered an embarrassment.,"Ke edi nte enye okodu mi ke ukperedem utọk ye Wolverstone, oro ẹkeda nte nsuaan̄a."
2604,Wolverstone never got into a dispute with her.,Wolverstone kpa ikọtọhọ ye enye.
2617,He had suddenly asked a question as to who you may be.,Enye ama ọsọsọp obụp mbụme ete anie ke afo ekemede ndidi.
2618,He quietly murmured to himself the whole time.,Enye ama ọsọbọ ikọ ye idem esie sụn̄-sụn̄ ofụri ini oro.
2619,The person was actually the devil himself.,Owo oro ke akpanikọ ekedi devil idemesie.
2620,"As the lordship, he showed no mercy to his subjects.","Nte ọbọn̄, enye ikatuakke ikọt esie mbọm."
2621,His lordship spoke calmly to all giving the impression of a warm and gentle person.,"Ọbọñ Esie ama etịn̄ ikọ ke sụk sụk nnọ kpukpru owo, ndien emi ama ọnọ ekikere nte ke enye edi owo ima ye owo sụk sụk."
2622,The Lord's voice felt both distant and chilling,Uyo Obong ama etie kpa nsannsan ye ntɔŋ idem.
2626,"As he is experienced, Captain Blood helped boost morale amongst his crew members.","Sia enye enyenede mbufiọk, Captain Blood ama an̄wam ndisịn mbon ụgbọ esie ke idem."
2627,Captain Blood yelled to Old Wolf.,Captain Iyịp ama ofiori nọ Akani Ikpọŋ.

2630,He has three eyes.,Enye enyene enyịn ita.

2632,The blood came from a person's eye as they had looked into the telescope.,Iyịp ọkọwọrọ owo ke enyịn koro enye ama okose esịt anyan-n̄kụt.

2637,The solution to the matter was more or less there.,"Usọbọ ke n̄kpọ oro ama odu do, n̄kpọ nte ntre."
2638,I want you to explain yourself! I know you know where Wolverstone is.,N̄yom fi anam an̄wan̄a idem fo! Mfiọk ke ọfiọk ebiet Wolverstone odude.
2639,Wolverstone is right here. No explanation needed.,Wolverstone odu mi emi. Un̄wan̄a iyomke.

2653,Ogle had attempted to give orders as though he were the Captain.,Ogle ama odomo ndinọ ewụhọ nte nte enye ekpedi Captain.
2654,The Captain of the ship was feeling rather ill.,Eteubom ubom ama okop udọn̄ọ ndusụk.
2655,There was no one on the ship to give orders.,Ikedụhe owo ndomokiet ke ubom ndinọ ewụhọ.
2662,The ship will sink unless the crew acts fast.,Ubom eyenyịm ibọhọke mbon ubom ẹnam n̄kpọ ọsọsọp.
2663,There is a way for them to sink.,Enyene usụn̄ nnọ mmọ ndidep.
2664,They can not possibly sink in any circumstance.,Mmọ ikemeke ndidịbi ke baba idaha kiet.
2668,The Wolverstone completely haulted.,Wolverstone ama adaña sakkade.
2669,The Wolverstone did not come to an end.,Wolverstone iketreke.
2670,The Wolverstone was part of an elaborate ploy.,Wolverstone ama edi ubak ke ọkpọsọn̄ mbubịk.
2671,He never desired to be anything like that dog in that one fable.,Enye pen̄ke akaduak ndidi baba nkpo kiet nte ebua oro ke ñke kiet oro.
2672,The fable is as old as time.,Ñke emi ebịghi nte ererimbot.
2673,There was once a story about a dog and a delusive shadow.,Ekedi mbụk kiet aban̄a ebua ye mfefere uwien.
2674,There might have been an error to give Captain Blood his commission.,Ekeme ndidi nsobo ama odu ke ndinọ Captain Blood iwetutom esie.
2675,There was no mistake in providing Captain Blood with his commission.,Ndudue ikodụhọ ke ndinọ Captain Blood iwetutom esie.
2676,There was the potential for error as the accountant was recently fired.,Ama odu itie ndudue sia ẹma ẹsio akantaŋ ke utom ndondo emi.
2710,He had moved his shoulders in a sign of acceptance.,Enye ama ọwọrọde afara esie ke idiọn̄ọ unyịme.
2711,He told them that he could see it but it was not a big deal in the end.,Enye ọkọdọhọ mmọ ke imọ ikokụt enye edi ikedịghe akamba n̄kpọ ke akpatre.
2712,"It was clear that staying could have helped me, so no question was ever posed.","Ama an̄wan̄a nte ke editie ekpekemede ndin̄wam mi, mmọ̀n̄ baba mbụme kiet ikọbụpke."
2719,He wants to see you about the Old Bear and not about the Old Wolf.,"Enye oyom ndikut fi abanga Akamba Bear, idịghe abanga Akamba Wolf."
2720,He wants to see you about the Old Wolf.,Enye oyom ndikụt fi abanga Akani Wolf.
2721,He wants to see you today about the Old Wolf.,Enye oyom ndikụt fi mfịn abanga Akani Ikpọwolf.
2722,His choice was between buying 12 chickens or 3 oxen.,Ekemek esie ekedi ke ufọt edidep unen duopeba m̀mê enan ita.
2723,His lordship believed that either choice would have had a substantial impact.,Ọbọñ Esie ama enịm ke ekededi ke otu mkpọk mbiba oro akpakanam akwa n̄kpọ.
2724,"Whether or not he chose to act, his lordship did not believe it would have changed anything.","M̀mê enye ama emek ndinam n̄kpọ m̀mê ikemekke, Ọbọñ esie ikenịmke ke oro ọkpọkpụhọde baba n̄kpọ kiet."
2740,He did not like what you said.,Enye ikemaha se afo eketịn̄de.
2741,He is going to punish you for those words.,Enye ọmọn̄ anọ fi ufen ke ntak mme ikọ oro.
2742,He really enjoyed what you said.,Enye ama enem esịt etieti ye se afo eketịn̄de.
2749,He was wrong and she said nothing.,Enye ikenenke ndien enye iketịn̄ke baba n̄kpọ kiet.
2750,She fixed his issue.,Enye ọkọdiọn̄ọ mfịna esie.
2751,She was always tasked with correcting him.,Ẹma ẹsinọ enye utom ndinen̄ede enye.
2752,Julian looked serious but was actually amused.,"Julian ama ọsọn̄ọ iso, edi ke akpanikọ, ama asak ke esịt."
2753,Julian thought the situation was funny.,Julian ekekere ke nkpo oro ama enye nsahi.
2754,Julian was being clear about his feelings.,Julian ama anam an̄wan̄a mme nkpo-esit esie.
2764,The lordship just took my advice and carried his acts accordingly.,"Ọbọñ-Ọkpọñ ama ada item mi, ọnyuñ anam mme edinam esie kpa nte item oro ọkọdọhọde."
2765,"While the lordship was very smart, his grave mistake of not listening to my counsel will spell the end of the kingdom.","Okposụkedi Obong ekedide ọniọn̄ etieti, akwa ndudue esie ndikpọn̄ ndikop item mi eyedi utịt nnọ obio ubọn̄."
2766,Your lordship has chosen to act in a manner against my advice.,Ọbọñ Inyieñ amemek ndinam n̄kpọ ke usụn̄ emi ọbiọn̄ọde item mi.
2779,He asked because he was rather shocked about the whole situation.,Enye ama obụp koro idem ama akpa enye etieti aban̄a ofụri idaha oro.
2780,He had shouted a question.,Enye ama ọfiori mbụme.
2781,He never posed a question as he remained silent.,Enye ikobụpke mbụme kpa sia enye ama odop uyo.
2800,People from the forecastle were joining the men in the waist.,Mme owo ẹtode ke iso ụgbọenyịn ẹkesụk ẹdiana ye nditọiren ke ufọt ụgbọenyịn.
2801,Some people believed the tale that the princess had been eaten by a dragon.,Ndusụk owo ẹkenịm mbụk oro nte ke dragon ama adia ọmọ-ọbọñ an̄wan.
2802,"The ranks of men were dwindling, as everyone headed towards the forecastle for dinner.","Mme udịm owo ẹkesụhọrede, nte kpukpru owo ẹkewọrọde ẹka n̄kan̄ iso ubom ndidia udia mbubreyo."
2812,It decreased his excitement.,Enye ama osụhọde idatesịt esie.
2813,It made him more excited than he had ever been.,Enye ama anam enye ọdara akan nte enye akanam ọdarade.
2814,It made him more excited.,Akanam esịt enem enye akan.
2815,There was no way of knowing if the boat would still move forward.,Ikọdụhe usụn̄ ndifiọk m̀mê ụgbọ mmọn̄ oro osụk akpaka iso.
2816,There was nothing able to slow down the ship.,Nkpo ikodụhe emi ekemede ndisịmede ubom oro.
2817,"We will attempt to battle over it, once we begin to sail.","Iyodom ndin̄wana kaban̄a enye, ke ini itọn̄ọde ndiwat nsụn̄."
2821,Blood said nothing to the man he encountered.,Blood ikọbọhọ n̄kpọ nọ erenowo oro emi enye okosobode.
2822,Blood wished the man a good day.,Blood ọkọdọñọ erenowo oro ọfọñ usen.
2823,The man was old.,Erenowo oro ama akani.
2833,A person who is shouting decides to fix someone else's mistake.,Owo emi ọfioride ebiere ndidọhọ ndudue owo efen.
2834,His Majesty's Deputy-Governer of Jamaica is already dead.,Andi-ñwọñọ-ñkpo Ọbọñ Obio eke Ọbọñ Enyieñ ke Jamaica ama akpa.
2835,One man told the other that he had done his work perfectly and that any mistakes were his own fault.,"Owo kiet ọkọdọhọ owo efen nte ke enye ama anam utom esie ọfọn ama, ndien nte ke ndudue ekededi ekedi ndudue esie ikpọn̄."
2842,I was expecting your arrival said the Deputy-Governor.,"Ami n̄keben̄e edisịm fo,"" ọkọdọhọ Andi-n̄wam Andikara."
2843,"The Deputy-Governor was not necessarily expecting him, though greeted him anyways.","Andi-bio Andidem ikenen̄ekede idori enyịn ye enye, kpa ye oro, ama ọkọm enye n̄kpọkọbi."
2844,There was some remorse when the Deputy-Governor had waved hello.,Mfụhọ ama odu ke ini Andi-ibuot Ukara ama ọkọfọi ubọk ọkọm.
2851,He didn't have any arms so he asked someone else to point to the girl.,"Enye ikenịmke ubọk ndomokiet, ntre enye ọkọdọhọ owo en̄wen ete ọtọŋọ ubọk owụt eyenan̄wan oro."
2852,He pointed at the girl.,Enye ama ọtọhọ ubọk owụt eyenan̄wan oro.
2853,The girl had blonde hair.,Eyen an̄wan oro ama enyene idet emi anade ndufo-ndufo.
2860,Ogle never mentioned anyone who disliked the current course.,Ogle ikesiakke akananam owo ndomokiet emi mîmaha usụn̄ idahaemi.
2861,"Some did not like the idea of the current course and refuted it, explicitly.","Ndusụk ikamaha ekikere aban̄a usụn̄ emi ẹdade idahaemi, ẹnyụn̄ ẹbọrọ enye ke n̄kpọ-ubọk, n̄kan̄-n̄kan̄."
2862,"The course was full of territory that was left unexplored and was, therefore, very dangerous.","Usụn̄ oro ọkọyọhọ ye isọn̄ emi ẹkedepde mîdụn̄ọdeke, ndien ke ntak oro, ọkọdiọk etieti."
2881,It doesn't matter what I think of you.,Inamke n̄kpọ se n̄kerede mbanā fo.
2882,You might care what I think about you.,Afo emekeme ndikere se n̄kerede mban̄a fi.
2883,You should definitely care about what I think of you.,Afo akpana enen̄ede ekere se n̄kerede mban̄a fi.
2887,"As many said before, Wolverstone was a simple man with few words.","Nte ediwak owo ẹketịn̄de mbemiso, Wolverstone ekedi owo emi mînyeneke n̄kpọ ye n̄kpọ, onyụn̄ edi owo esisịt ikọ."
2888,I felt very bubbled by the words of Wolverstone.,N̄kọbọrọ nte idem ọsọp mi etieti ke ikọ Wolverstone.
2889,Wolverstone had said something that did not make one feel bubbled.,Wolverstone ama ọkọdọhọ nkpọ emi mîkọnamke owo enyene idatesịt.
2893,"The night was considered restful though, there was a lot of commotion later on.","Okoneyo ẹkeda nte eke nduọkodudu, okposụkedi uyom ama okpon etieti ke ukperedem."
2894,The night was extremely busy as the streets were packed with people.,Okoneyo ama ọfọp etieti sia mme efak ẹma ẹbọbọp owo.
2895,This evening was busier than usual because of an event being hosted.,"Mbubreyo emi utom ama awak akan nte esidide, oto ke ntak ubọkọkọ oro ẹkenịmde."
2896,"Encouraging this, she had found many reasons as to why one would trouble themselves to defend you.","Ke ndisịn udọn̄ ke emi, enye ama okokụt ediwak ntak emi owo ekpetịmede idem ndin̄wana nnọ fi."
2897,She had discouraged any form of defense that was applicable to you.,Enye ama ọdọhọ ke orụk ukpeme ekededi emi ekekemde ye afo idịghe n̄kpọ ufọn.
